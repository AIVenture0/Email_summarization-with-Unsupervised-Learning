"Ciao Maurizio,

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible. 

Alternatively, you can also disable the notification badge completely in your general system settings under ""Notifications"" -> "" "" -> ""Badge App Icon"". 

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon. 

Se doveste avere ulteriori domande, proposte per miglioramenti o commenti generali, non esitate a contattarmi di nuovo.

Tanti saluti,

"Hi Stephane,

Thank you for keeping me updated on this issue. I'm happy to hear that the issue got resolved after all and you can now use   in its full functionality again. 
Also many thanks for your suggestions. For cards that are mainly using (for example) QR codes, the scanning example will also adapt to this format.
We hope to improve this feature for all cards in the future. 

In case you experience any further problems with your   app, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Nick,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

I checked our servers and I'm happy to tell you that I was able to find a   Backup account created via the ""Email"" login option and connected to your mail address nickvanbaelen@gmail.com. It was last updated in December 2017 and currently contains 20 cards. It is indeed very unusual that   would not restore your backup if your log into your   Backup email account now. 

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your problem without further information. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to tell me which device and operating system you are using our   app on. It would also be helpful to know which version of the   app you are currently running. To check your version, please go to your   settings and click on ""About"" (Android) or scroll to the end of the settings page (iOS). 

Moreover, would it be possible to send me a screenshot of your   Backup screen after you tried to log into your account?

Merci pour votre message et feedback! Nous sommes très heureux d’entendre que   vous plaît. Nous travaillons de jour en jour pour améliorer et développer notre application pour nos utilisateurs afin d’ultimement rendre le portefeuille physique obsolète.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to manually change the order of your cards in  . They will automatically get sorted alphabetically. However, you could us one of our integrated sorting tools. 

For   on Android devices, you can decide whether you prefer having your cards sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use or by last used. You can change this setting in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Sort card list by"".

For   on iOS devices we offer our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section which will be displayed on top of your card list. They are normally either those four cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, you cannot manually edit the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving these features though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions, suggestions or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround.

Большое спасибо за ваше обращение и за то, что нашли время, чтобы связаться с нами по этому вопросу! К сожалению, я не владею русский, поэтому, надеюсь, вы поймете, если я отвечу на английском:

You can add a picture of the front and back side of your loyalty cards by opening a specific card and going to the ""Notes"" section. 
In this section you can upload a picture from your gallery or take one using your phone's camera. Furthermore, you can also add some notes to your cards. 
I hope this information is useful to you.

"Guten Tag Frau Berger, 

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben. 

Dürfte ich Sie fragen, ob Sie noch Zugang zu   auf Ihrem alten Handy haben? Damit Sie Ihre Karten bei einem Gerätewechsel auf ein neues Handy übertragen können, müssen Sie zuvor ein Backup Ihrer Karten in   erstellen, welches Sie dann auf Ihrem neuen Handy wiederherstellen können. Dafür gibt es das   Backup, eine Funktion innerhalb der   App, die es Ihnen erlaubt, Ihre Karten in unserer Cloud zu sichern und auf ein weiteres mobiles Gerät zu übertragen. Dies funktioniert folgendermaßen:

Backup auf Ihrem alten Handy erstellen:
1. Bitte gehen Sie zu den Einstellungen in   und wählen Sie dann ""  Backup"" (Android) oder ""Backup"" (iOS). 
2. Nun können Sie sich entweder mit Facebook, Google oder einer privaten E-Mail Adresse einloggen. 
3. Ihre Karten sind gespeichert, sobald Sie erfolgreich angemeldet sind (iOS), oder Sie können danach auf ""Backup jetzt erstellen"" gehen (Android).

Karten auf Ihrem neuen Handy wiederherstellen:
1. Bitte gehen Sie wieder über die Einstellungen in   zum   Backup auf Ihrem neuen Handy.
2. Melden Sie sich mit denselben Daten an, wie auf dem alten Gerät (wenn Sie beispielsweise Google benutzt haben, bitte wieder über Google anmelden und nicht über E-Mail Adresse).
3. Sobald Sie angemeldet sind, werden Ihre Karten automatisch wiederhergestellt, oder es öffnet sich ein Fenster mit den Optionen entweder ein neues Backup anzulegen, oder ein altes Backup wiederherzustellen. Bitte wählen Sie die zweite Option aus (Backup wiederherstellen) und danach sollten alle Ihre Karten automatisch auf dem neuen Handy zur Verfügung stehen.

Bitte beachten Sie, dass einige Nutzer Probleme hatten, die Karten über Facebook wiederherzustellen. Ich empfehle daher, entweder Google oder eine E-Mail Adresse zu verwenden, bis das Problem mit Facebook behoben ist. Des Weiteren würde ich Ihnen raten, darauf zu achten, dass Sie Sich auf Ihrem alten Handy aus Ihrem Backup Account abmelden, bevor Sie Sich auf Ihrem neuen Handy in den selben Account einloggen. 

Ich würde Ihnen außerdem sehr empfehlen, ab sofort das   Backup zu nutzen, damit Sie Ihre Karten wiederherstellen können für den Fall, dass Sie die App deinstallieren oder das Smartphone wechseln. 

Ich hoffe, ich konnte Ihnen damit weiterhelfen. Falls etwas nicht funktioniert, oder Sie weitere Fragen haben, können Sie uns gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

"Hi Kim,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our app!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Best regards,

"Hi Tom,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! We're happy to hear that you're thinking about giving our   app a try!

Unfortunately, I have to tell you that it's not possible to transfer all your cards from the KeyRing application directly to  . This is due to the fact that we don't have access to KeyRings application programming interface. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. However, in case you don't want to search for all your plastic cards again so that you can scan them into  , you always have the possibility to manually enter your card number instead.

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

Unfortunately, we are currently experiencing a problem with restoring   Backups created via the Facebook login option across platforms (e.g. iOS to Android or vice versa).

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon. 

Do you by any chance still have access to   on your iPhone so that you could create a new backup using either the Google or Email login option? These transfer methods should still work properly.

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. Se doveste avere ulteriori domande, proposte per miglioramenti o commenti generali, non esitate a contattarmi di nuovo.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, after changing phones you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. Unfortunately, backing up your device in general (e.g. via iCloud) won't save your card data in  . I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case you reinstall the app or change your phone. You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices). If you still have access to   on your old phone you can still create a backup of your cards and transfer them to your new device.

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns diesbezüglich zu kontaktieren. 

Leider muss ich Ihnen mitteilen, dass es uns nicht möglich ist, Ihre Karten aus der Vodafone Wallet App in die   App zu importieren. Das liegt vor allem daran, dass wir keinen Zugriff auf die Daten aus anderen Apps haben. Sie haben jedoch die Möglichkeit, Ihre Kartennummern in   manuell einzugeben, anstatt den Barcode auf Ihrer tatsächlichen Plastikkarte zu scannen. Auf diese Weise müssen Sie nicht extra alle Plastikkarten erneut suchen. Wir entschuldigen uns dennoch vielmals für die Unannehmlichkeiten, die Ihnen dadurch entstehen.

I'm afraid, this problem seems to be related to the resolution of your device. Unfortunately, it seems like the Wileyfox Swift is reporting a wrong pixel density to   which leads to our app assuming an incorrect display size.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores, irrespective of the barcode size. We create all barcodes in   in a size that can easily be scanned from a short distance. However, some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. Beep'n'Go was able to avoid this problem by using the so-called Samsung Beaming Service. This technology transfers the barcode from your phone's screen directly into the scanner via NFC, thus making it possible to use digital barcodes also with older scanning devices. Since we are aware that Beep'n'Go went out of business last year, we have already reached out to Samsung in order to make their beaming service available in   instead. Unfortunately, Samsung currently restricts the usage of their technology for third parties. Therefore, I'm afraid, we cannot offer your barcode beaming in   at the moment. 

Nevertheless, we hope to be able to solve this problem soon as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update.

"Hi Aisha,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to heat that you like our app! 

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

The reason for this is most likely that you are manually entering the card number which is printed on the front side of the card. However, in order to create a valid barcode   needs the barcode ID. There should be a barcode on the back of your physical Club Vips card. The easiest way would be to simply scan this barcode with your phone's camera. However, you can of course also manually enter the barcode iD which is printed below the barcode. After your card has been properly added,   will display both your barcode ID and customer number. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Karen, 

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. Beep'n'Go was able to avoid this problem by using the so-called Samsung Beaming Service. This technology transfers the barcode from your phone's screen directly into the scanner, thus making it possible to use digital barcodes also with older scanning devices. Since we are aware that Beep'n'Go went out of business last year, we have already reached out to Samsung in order to make their beaming service available in   instead. Unfortunately, Samsung currently restricts the usage of their technology for third parties. Therefore, I'm afraid, we cannot offer your barcode beaming in   at the moment. 

Nevertheless, we hope to be able to solve this problem soon as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Suzanne,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, after reinstalling   you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. However, all your accumulated loyalty points are still saved in your card accounts. Nevertheless, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case something like this happens again (or you reinstall the app or change your phone). You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices).

Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays.

Or did you mean you couldn't scan your cards into  ? In order to make scanning your loyalty cards into   as easy as possible, please ensure that you are in a sufficiently lighted environment first. In addition to that, please try not move the card while scanning it. I would recommend to put the card on a stable surface, for example a table. It might take a few seconds for the camera to focus on the barcode. If this is not working properly, you can also try to slightly move the camera back and forth until the camera focuses properly.

Merci pour votre message! Malheureusement, mon français n'est pas si bon. J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas, mais je vais devoir poursuivre en anglais :

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

I'm happy to inform you that it is already possible to add a card icon of your choice to your custom cards in  . Simply open the particular card and click on ""Modifier"" in the upper right corner of your card screen. If you now select ""Modifier l'image"", you have the possibility to upload an image of your choice as the card icon for this specific card. I would suggest to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. The front and back picture of your actual card can be stored in the ""Notes"" section of each instead. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their custom cards. We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your ""Other Cards"". Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

"Hi Hooi,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Unfortunately, the Apple Wallet only supports a few barcode types (QR, Aztec, PDF 417 and Code 128 with iOS 9 or higher). You can add all your loyalty cards in   with barcodes of these formats to the Apple Wallet by clicking on the ""Share Card"" button at the bottom of the card display screen (below the barcode) and then choosing ""Add to Apple Wallet"". Since   supports many more barcode types, there might be cards in   that you cannot add to Apple Wallet. The Woolworths card usually uses a barcode of the format EAN 13 which is not supported by the Wallet. Therefore, this cards won't have an ""Add to Apple Wallet"" button. Please excuse the inconvenience.

Большое спасибо за ваше обращение и за то, что нашли время, чтобы связаться с нами по этому вопросу! К сожалению, я не владею русский, поэтому, надеюсь, вы поймете, если я отвечу на английском:

I'm afraid, the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no synchronization between your accounts. That's why, when you add a card on one of your devices, it won't be automatically transferred to your second device.

"Hallo Joachim,

vielen Dank für Deine Nachricht und dafür, dass Du Dir die Zeit genommen hast, uns Rückmeldung zu geben. 

Leider ist unsere Support Website derzeit nur in englischer Sprache verfügbar. Du kannst jedoch jederzeit unseren Support direkt kontaktieren, solltest Du eine Frage oder ein Problem mit Deiner   App haben. 

Normalerweise deutet der Kennzeichenzähler darauf hin, dass neue Angebote in   verfügbar sind und sollte wieder verschwinden, sobald alle neuen Angebote einmal geöffnet wurden. Leider gibt es jedoch derzeit auf einigen wenigen Geräten das Problem, dass die Benachrichtigung über neue Angebote in   nicht verschwindet, obwohl bereits alle neuen Angebote einmal geöffnet wurden. Ich kann Dir jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwicklern über dieses Problem bereits informiert sind und derzeit versuchen, diesen Fehler so schnell wie möglich zu beheben. In der Zwischenzeit möchten wir uns aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen. 

Alternativ kannst Du den Kennzeichenzähler, oder auch die Benachrichtigungen für   deaktivieren. Gehe dazu einfach in die Einstellungen Deines Geräts und wähle ""Mitteilungen"" -> "" "" aus. 

Ich hoffe, dass ich Dir damit weiterhelfen konnte. Solltest Du weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, kannst Du uns gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

"Hi Dirk,

Hartelijk dank dat u ons gecontacteerd heeft en de tijd heeft genomen om ons feedback te geven! Het wordt zeer gewaardeerd!

Helaas treden deze scanproblemen voornamelijk op vanwege oudere scantechnieken die nog steeds gebruikt worden door enkele winkels. Enkele toestellen (bijv. laserscanners of flatbedscanners) hebben problemen smartphoneschermen af te lezen. Echter, we hopen dit probleem snel te verhelpen aangezien de meeste winkels hopelijk deze scantoestellen vervangen door nieuwere, op afbeeldingen gebaseerde scanners bij hun volgende kassasysteem-update. Tot die tijd lijkt het het beste om het winkelpersoneel te vragen het kaartnummer met de hand in te voeren in deze gevallen zodat u geen beloningspunten of kortingen mist. 

In de tussentijd bieden we onze oprechte excuses aan voor het ongemak dat dit veroorzaakt. 

Ik hoop dat deze informatie behulpzaam is voor u. Indien u verder nog vragen, suggesties ter verbetering of algemene feedback heeft, contacteer mij dan gerust opnieuw.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. Unfortunately, backing your phone up via iCloud won't save your card data in  . I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case something like this happens again (or you reinstall the app or change your phone). You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices).

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Thank you very much for your screenshots!

I checked the barcode on your Tesco Clubcard and consulted one of our developers to ensure I give you the correct information about this. It seems like the barcode on your physical card indeed contains a lot more information than only your individual card number. Our team is currently working on converting the characters that appear after scanning your card into your Tesco Clubcard number. However, in the meantime your card is still valid and usable if your simply save the scanned input without conducting any changes on it. Since you card number is not yet displayed below your digital Tesco barcode, I would recommend to store a front picture of your physical card in the ""Notes"" section in   so that you also have your card number at hand when you need it. 

Please excuse the confusion. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Liliana,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm happy to help you with this! 

The   iPhone widget gives you fast and easy access to your eight most frequently used cards. You can enable the   widget the following way: 

1. Slide your finger from left to right on your lock screen to display the Today's view. Scroll down to the end of the page and choose ""Edit"".
2. Now you can see which widgets are already enabled (they display a red minus in front of them).
3. Please add the   widget to the Today's view by searching it in the ""More Widgets"" list and clicking on the green plus.
4. The   widget with your most frequently used cards should now be displayed in your center. When you click on a card, it will immediately open in  .

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again. 

Best regards,

"Hi Jaimie,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

Did you know that there is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device? With the   Backup you can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Best regards,

"Hi Diego,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

"Hi Rolf,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm very sorry to hear that! 

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your problem without further information. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to tell me which device and operating system you are using our   app on. It would also be helpful to know which version of the   app you are currently running. To check your version, please go to your   settings and click on ""About"" (Android) or scroll to the end of the settings page (iOS). 

Moreover, may I ask which login option you chose for your   Backup account (Facebook, Google or mail address)? Would it be possible for you to send me a screenshot of the error message you receive?

Many thanks and best regards,

"Hallo Rolf, 

vielen Dank für die Informationen zu Deinen Geräten. 

Leider gibt es derzeit auf einigen wenigen iPhone Geräten ein Problem mit dem Login zum   Backup. Es scheint, als würde dieser Fehler auch auf Deinem iPhone 4S passieren. Ich kann Dir jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits darüber informiert sind und derzeit versuchen, das Problem schnellstmöglich zu beheben. Bis dahin ist es leider nicht möglich sich beim   Backup anzumelden.

Unser nächstes Update befindet sich jedoch schon fast in der Betatest-Phase. Es wird also nicht mehr allzu lange dauern, bis das   Backup wieder fehlerfrei zu benutzen ist. Falls Du Deine Kartendaten in   jedoch sofort übertragen möchtest, wäre die andere Möglichkeit, ein iTunes Backup Deines alten iPhones über Deinem Computer zu erstellen und dieses dann auf dem iPhone 7 wiederherzustellen. Im Gegensatz zu einem Backup über iClou, sichert ein iTunes Backup auch Deine Karten in  . 

Wir entschuldigen uns dennoch vielmals für die Unannehmlichkeiten und hoffen, dass Du   schon bald wieder in vollem Umfang nutzen kannst.

Solltest Du weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, kannst Du uns gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

Beste Grüße,

"Hi Jose,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Unfortunately, I don't speak Portuguese so I hope it is alright if I answer in English instead:

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. This might also be the case at the Continente store. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

"Hi Richard,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

The reason for this is that our   watch app for Android Wear is not a standalone app but rather gets synchronized with   on your Android Phone. 

In order to get   running on your watch it is therefore necessary to sync   on your smartwatch with your   phone app. To do that, please make sure that your watch as well as the   phone app and the Android Wear app on your phone have all available updates installed. Now, please open the Android Wear app on your phone, click on the ""Settings Gear"", select your watch and click ""Resync apps"". After these steps, the   watch app should be available again.

Alternatively, for Android Wear 2.0 devices it should also be possible to open the Google Play Store on your watch and scroll to the very bottom of the page. Here you should find a section called ""Apps from my Phone"" where you should also find the   app. 

Please note that the sync process might take some time. However, when the process is finished the   watch app will automatically appear on your smartwatch.

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Aleisa,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our idea! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, the problem is that some companies have different catalogues for different regions in Australia (e.g. different prices for NSW and QLD). Since you can currently only choose the region Australia and not a certain state or region within Australia, it can happen that there is only one catalogue online which might not be the right one for your location. I can assure you that we are aware of the problem though and will try to differentiate between the states in the future. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that we can provide your with better localized offers very soon.

Furthermore, I'm happy to tell you that such a reminder feature already exists. The   Card Assistant is a feature in   which accesses your current location in order to remind you to use your loyalty cards when you are near selected stores. Moreover, via the Card Assistant notification you receive, it is possible to directly access the corresponding loyalty card via the lock screen without having to open the   app first. You will find the Card Assistant in your settings in   under ""  Card Assistant"" (Android) or ""Card Assistant"" (iOS).

Unfortunately, this feature is not available for all listed cards in   yet. We try to add more cards and store locations to this feature with every new update though and hope that we can offer this service for all your cards in the future.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no synchronization between your accounts. That's why, when you add a card on one of your devices, it won't be automatically transferred to your second device. We are constantly trying to improve our app though and a synchronization feature is something we have already been working on for quite some time. I hope that we can include it to   soon. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this missing feature causes. 

However, it should still be possible to restore your backup on your tablet. Usually, to transfer your data to another device you need to follow the steps below:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

I hope I was able to help you but in case the restore is still not working properly, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Steve,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to manually change the order of your cards in   or mark some cards as your favorites. They will automatically get sorted alphabetically. However, you could us one of our integrated sorting tools. 

For   on Android devices, you can decide whether you prefer having your cards sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use or by last used. You can change this setting in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Sort card list by"".

For   on iOS devices we offer our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section which will be displayed on top of your card list. They are normally either those four cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, you cannot manually edit the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving these features though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

1. Abra la aplicación   y haga clic en el botón ""+"" - en la esquina superior derecha (iOS) o en la esquina inferior derecha (Android) de la pantalla.
2. Escriba el nombre del proveedor de su tarjeta de lealtad en el campo de búsqueda o desplácese por la lista. Si no puede encontrar la tarjeta que desea incluir en la lista, aún puede agregarla a   al elegir agregarla como ""Otra tarjeta"".
3. Dependiendo de la tarjeta de fidelidad elegida, aparecerá el escáner de código de barras o un campo para escribir manualmente su ID de cliente.

"Hi Nicholas,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

Best regards,

"Hi Tomas,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our app and it's simplicity! Please excuse the delayed response. 

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for four next release. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

I'm afraid, it is not possible to send yourself a copy of your backup via email. If you choose to use the   Backup feature, your backup will be stored in our   Cloud and can only be restored via the   app again. The ""Facebook"", ""Google"" and ""Email"" buttons are simply the login methods you can choose to access your   Backup account.

"Hi again,

Thank you so much for your suggestions! 

I'm happy to inform you that it is already possible to share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps. All cards that can be shared now have a ""Share Card"" button below the barcode (iOS) or you can click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your card screen in order to open the menu bar and then choose ""Share"" (Android). 

By sharing a card, you will send a link that enables your friends or family to add your card to their own   app. Please keep in mind though that the link you send expires after a short amount of time due to data privacy issues and has to be send again if it is not opened in time. 

Moreover, we are constantly trying to improve our app though and a synchronization feature is something we have already been working on for quite some time. I hope that we can include it to   soon. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this missing feature causes.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. Beep'n'Go was able to avoid this problem by using the so-called Samsung Beaming Service. This technology transfers the barcode from your phone's screen directly into the scanner, thus making it possible to use digital barcodes also with older scanning devices. Since we are aware that Beep'n'Go went out of business last year, we have already reached out to Samsung in order to make their beaming service available in   instead. Unfortunately, Samsung currently restricts the usage of their technology. Therefore, I'm afraid, we cannot offer your barcode beaming in   at the moment. 

Nevertheless, we hope to be able to solve this problem soon as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

I'm afraid, it is not possible to delete or modify flyers or catalogues from the ""Offers"" section in   since this section ensures that   is and will always continue to be free of charge for our users. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this may cause for you. Free apps oftentimes have to show advertizements in their applications. We have decided to go with our ""Offers"" section instead since it can even add value to your shopping experience if your have the latest offers and discount always at your fingertips. 

However, I can assure you that these catalogues won't get downloaded onto your phone but are saved in the app's internal memory. Moreover, once an offer has expired it will automatically deleted. Furthermore, you have the possibility to disable all offer notifications from   so that you won't get bothered by this section any longer. Depending on the operating system you are using you can do the following:

You can turn off the push notifications for new offers in   by going to your iPhone's system settings, choosing ""Notifications"" -> "" "" and then disabling the push notifications for the   app.

I am happy to let you know that   does already support the ew Tesco Clubcard. Simply scan the code on your plastic Tesco Clubcard with your phone's camera and   will generate a digital copy for you. For 2D barcodes (e.g. QR codes) the barcode in   might look slightly different but has the same information than the one on your plastic card.

In the case of Tesco it might happen that you receive a message saying that ""the card number doesn't match the usual format"". You can simply ignore this message and choose to ""Save Anyway"" to get your digital Tesco QR code saved in  . The reason for this message is that we are currently in the process of updating all default barcode formats in   and have not yet changed the default barcode type for Tesco to QR code yet. Please excuse the confusion.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm very sorry to hear that! 

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your problem without further information. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to tell me which device and operating system you are using our   app on. It would also be helpful to know which version of the   app you are currently running. To check your version, please go to your   settings and click on ""About"" (Android) or scroll to the end of the settings page (iOS). 

Do you remember whether your cards disappeared following an update for   or for your operating system? Moreover, have you tried restarting your device yet? This might sound trivial but oftentimes this is simply a problem with loading your cards. Therefore, a simple phone restart can already solve the issue. 

Did you by any chance use our   Backup feature prior to this incident?

"Hi Gaelah, 

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

I'm afraid, sometimes it can indeed take a few days until your points balance in   gets updated after a purchase. You can try to speed up this process by logging out of your particular card account and the logging in again, thus forcing your balance to get updated. Have you checked your points balance on the Nectar website yet? Is there a larger amount of points displayed?

In general, please make sure to wait for a visible or audible feedback from the scanning device when using your digital loyalty cards in   to ensure that the scanner picked up your card properly. For example laser or flatbed scanners still have some difficulties scanning phone displays in general.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

I'm afraid, there is always only one copy of your cards stored in our   Cloud.

"¡Hola Carmen!

Muchas gracias por contactarnos por este asunto y enviarnos tu comentario.

¿Te podría preguntar que pasa exactamente si quieres usar   en la tienda de Día? ¿Hay problemas al escanear la tarjeta?
Los problemas de escaneo ocurren principalmente debido a tecnologías de escaneo obsoletas que todavía usan algunas tiendas. Algunos dispositivos (por ejemplo, escáneres láser o escáneres de cama plana) tienen dificultades para leer pantallas de smartphones. Esperamos poder resolver este problema pronto, y que la mayoría de las tiendas reemplacen sus escáneres obsoletos por escáneres con una nueva tecnología, basada en imágenes, en el curso de su próxima actualización del sistema cajero. Hasta entonces, sería mejor pedirle al cajero que ingrese el número de la tarjeta manualmente en estos casos para que no se pierda ningún punto o descuento de recompensa.

Mientras tanto, me disculpo sinceramente por las molestias que esto ocasiona.

Una vez más, gracias por tomarte el tiempo para contactarnos. Espero que esta información te sea útil. 
Me gustaría mucho recibir otro mensaje de tu parte en caso de que tengas otra pregunta o sugerencia para nosotros. 

Un saludo,

Greetings, Until then, it would be better to ask the cashier to enter the card number manually in these cases so that no reward point or discount is lost. I hope this information is useful for you."
"Guten Tag Herr Geiken,

vielen lieben Dank, dass Sie mir Ihren Screenshot erneut zugesendet haben. 

Es ist in der Tat ungewöhnlich, dass Sie diese Fehlermeldung bekommen. Auf unseren Test Geräten ist die Backup Erstellung weiterhin fehlerfrei möglich, daher handelt es sich nicht um ein allgemeines Server Problem. Ich würde Sie bitten, einmal in die allgemeinen Einstellungen Ihres Geräts zu gehen und den ""Anwendungsmanager"" zu öffnen. Suchen Sie hier bitte nach   und leeren Sie dann unter ""Speicher"" den Cache der App. Starten Sie Ihr Gerät nun bitte einmal neu. Das mag zunächst trivial klingen, jedoch kann ein Geräteneustart bei solchen Probleme häufig bereits Abhilfe schaffen. 

Haben Sie die Erstellung Ihres Backups bisher nur mit WLAN-Verbindung versucht, oder auch schon mit mobiler Datennutzung? Haben Sie die selbe oder eine andere E-Mail Adresse benutzt, bei dem Versuch einBackup über E-Mail zu nutzen?

Vielen Dank und beste Grüße,

Merci pour votre message! Malheureusement, mon français n'est pas si bon. J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas, mais je vais devoir poursuivre en anglais :

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

I'm afraid, the feature to retrieve your current points balance in   is currently only available for selected cards and regions. For those cards you will find a ""Points"" tab next to your ""Card"" and ""Notes"" tab. In the case of Leclerc, the points feature is currently only available for the region France. Do you have the region France enabled and still cannot retrieve your Leclerc points balance?

In case I misunderstood you, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Usually, if the ""Lock with Touch ID"" features is activated it should be possible to access your   app with either your fingerprint or the passcode you chose. However, Touch ID oftentimes fails, e.g. if your hands are wet or if you used hand lotion. Does your Touch ID always work well when unlocking your iPhone in general or does this problem also occur there?

"Hi Brooke,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your problem without further information. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to tell me which device you are using our   app on and which Android or iOS version it is currently running. It would also be helpful to know which version of the   app you are currently running. To check your version, please go to your   settings and click on ""About"" (Android) or scroll to the end of the settings page (iOS). 

Usually, the only screen light setting we do have enabled in   is that we will auto-adjust your screen brightness to the maximum level when a card is opened. The reason for this setting is that is makes the scanning process in store easier. However, as soon as the card is closed again, your screen brightness will return to its previous level. 

Would it be possible for you to send us a screenshot of what exactly happens so that our developers can take a look?

"Hi Sanne,

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, there currently is no setting to change the mail address connected to your   Backup account. However, if you would like to change this mail address, you can simply create a new account using the updated mail address so that all your cards in   will be connected to your new account. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. 

I hope I was able to help you with your question. Indien u verder nog vragen, suggesties ter verbetering of algemene feedback heeft, contacteer mij dan gerust opnieuw.

"Hi James,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible. 

Alternatively, you can also disable the notification badge completely in your general system settings under ""Notifications"" -> "" "" -> ""Badge App Icon"". 

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon. 

If you have any further questions, suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Nick,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm happy to help you with this! 

I assume when you go to the   Backup section and choose to log in via Google now,   automatically tries to connect with the Google account you entered the first time but it doesn't work because the password was incorrect? I'm afraid, in order to be able to enter your Google account and password again it is necessary to temporarily log out of your Google account on all other apps on your phone (e.g. your mailing client, Google calendar, Youtube, etc.). Otherwise,   will detect that you use this Google account in other apps and automatically try to connect without giving you the option to enter your password again. However, once you're logged out you will be able to enter everything again. Please excuse the inconvenience.

"Hi Jo,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that retailers decide to refuse   in order to push their own loyalty card applications.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

"Hi Luc,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us your suggestion to make it possible to change the position of the barcode in   so that you can also use it at stationary scanners!

We are always open to new ideas and really appreciate your message. We will discuss the idea in detail and, if applicable, try to include such a feature in   in the future. In the meantime, we apologize for the inconvenience. 

Until then, there might already be a workaround in case you are using   on an iPhone. On iPhone devices you can enable the so-called one hand mode in your system settings under ""General"" -> ""Accessibility"" -> ""Reachability"". If you now open your card in   and double tap (not press) the home button, the top half of your screen will be brought down to the middle of the display, resulting in the barcode being displayed at the very bottom of the screen. This way, it should be possible to use your digital cards in   also at stationary scanners. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any more questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, we'd be happy to hear from you again.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

I'm afraid, the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no synchronization between your accounts. That's why, when you add a card on one of your devices, it won't be automatically transferred to your second device. Due to this limitations we would advise you to log out of your   Backup account on your main device after you created your backup. Then you can log into the same account on the second device and choose to restore your cards. 

We are constantly trying to improve our app though and a synchronization feature is something we have already been working on for quite some time. I hope that we can include it to   soon. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this missing feature causes.

Do you by any chance have an Air Miles card stored in  ?

Furthermore, another problem is that some companies have different catalogues for different regions in Canada. Since you can currently only choose the overall region Canada and not a certain province within Canada, it can happen that there is only one catalogue online which might not be the right one for your location. I can assure you that we are aware of the problem though and will try to differentiate between the provinces in the future.

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that we can offer you better localized offers soon.

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please do not hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

In general, which flyers or catalogues you get displayed in your ""Offers"" section in   depends on the cards you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your   settings. Unfortunately, not all card providers decide to display their flyers or catalogues regularly. Moreover, some card providers don't want to show their catalogues in   at all. This is why it is possible that you don't receive offers for all of your added cards in  . On the other hand, some card providers decide to make their catalogues available to an entire region instead of only to their respective loyalty card holders. This is why you might see some offers for cards you don't have added. This might also be the case for Safeway Canada. However, it could also be the case that this Safeway offer is related to an Air Miles card since you can also use Air Miles at Safeway stores.

"Hi again,

Thank you very much for your screenshot!

Unfortunately, the ""Bad Request 400"" error is a problem with the   Backup login on very few iOS devices at the moment. It seems like your   Backup account connected to your mail address mhogrefe@stny.rr.com was indeed created but due to this error there are no cards stored in it. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of this issue and are currently trying to solve the problem as soon as possible. I am afraid you might not be able to log into your   Backup account or restore your cards on your new phone until then.

However, since both of your devices are iPhones there is another way of transferring your data. If your create an iTunes backup of your iPhone 6 via your computer, this backup will also contain your app data. Therefore, if your restore the backup on your iPhone 8, your card data in   will also get restored. 

Nevertheless, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again very soon.

It's indeed unusual that you don't receive any offers! This might sound trivial but have you tried restarting your device yet? Oftentimes a simple phone restart can already help solving such issues!

"Hallo Torben,

vielen Dank für Deine Nachricht und dafür, dass Du Dir die Zeit genommen hast, uns Rückmeldung zu geben. 

Leider gibt es derzeit auf einigen wenigen Geräten das Problem, dass die Benachrichtigung über neue Angebote in   nicht verschwindet, obwohl bereits alle neuen Angebote einmal geöffnet wurden. Ich kann Dir jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwicklern über dieses Problem bereits informiert sind und derzeit versuchen, diesen Fehler so schnell wie möglich zu beheben. Bis dahin hast Du die Möglichkeit, die Benachrichtigungen, oder auch den Kennzeichenzähler für neue Angebote in   zu deaktivieren. Gehe dazu einfach in die allgemeinen Einstellungen Deines Geräts und gehe zu ""Mitteilungen"" -> "" "".

In der Zwischenzeit möchten wir uns aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen und hoffen, dass Du   schon bald wieder fehlerfrei nutzen kannst. 

Solltest Du weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, kannst Du uns gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and giving us this valuable information regarding  's acceptance in Spain!

Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that retailer decide to refuse digital loyalty cards via   in order to push their own loyalty card applications. At   we believe that the customers should have the possibility to decide for themselves whether they want to install several apps for all stores they like to shop at or if they prefer storing all their cards in one app like  . We are optimistic though that we will come to an agreement with Carrefour in the future. 

Therefore, we will definitely further investigate this issue and try to increase the acceptance of digital loyalty cards via   at the Carrefour stores in the future. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this might have caused.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

I can assure you that   does not share your details with third parties (unless we are legally obligated to do so, e.g. to investigation authorities). May I ask what exactly you mean by nuisance calls? What we do in   is that we send you push notifications about offers for your loyalty cards. However, you can disable this feature either in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Offer notifications"" (Android) or in your general system settings under ""Notifications"" -> "" "" (iOS). Moreover, if your have our Card Assistent feature enabled,   will send you a reminder to use your loyalty cards when you are near selected stores. As soon as you disable the Card Assistant in your   settings, these notifications will also stop. We don't ever sent out adverts via text message, email or via phone calls. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, the Apple Wallet only supports a few barcode types (QR, Aztec, PDF 417 and Code 128 with iOS 9 or higher). You can add all your loyalty cards in   with barcodes of these formats to the Apple Wallet by clicking on the ""Share Card"" button at the bottom of the card display screen (below the barcode) and then choosing ""Add to Apple Wallet"". Since   supports many more barcode types, there might be cards in   that you cannot add to Apple Wallet. Therefore, these cards won't have an ""Add to Apple Wallet"" button. 

Moreover, the original idea behind the quadratic shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then automatically adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. The front and back picture of your actual card can be stored in the ""Notes"" section of each instead. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their custom cards. We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your ""Other Cards"". Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

"Hi Valerie,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

Moreover, the notification alert on the   app icon usually indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible. 

Alternatively, you can also disable the notification badge completely in your general system settings under ""Notifications"" -> "" "" -> ""Badge App Icon"". 

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm happy to help you with this!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on the other device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved.

"Guten Tag Herr Opitz,

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben.

Uns ist definitiv bewusst, dass die Ladezeiten unserer App mit den letzten Updates beträchtlich gestiegen sind. Ich kann Ihnen jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits mit Hochdruck daran arbeiten, diese mit zukünftigen Updates wieder auf ein Minimum zu senken. Bis dahin könnten Sie als Übergangslösung versuchen,   während Ihres Einkaufs im Hintergrund geöffnet zu lassen. So muss die App nicht bei jedem Öffnen alle Notizen, Kartenbilder, Punktstände, etc. vollständig neu laden und die Ladezeiten sollten sich spürbar verringern. 

In der Zwischenzeit möchte ich mich aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen und hoffe, dass wir Ihnen   schon bald wieder in verbesserter Geschwindigkeit anbieten können.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that we can offer you   on your Samsung Gear soon. 

Once again, thank you for contacting us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Marleen,

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

If you are using   on an iPhone, your cards will automatically get sorted alphabetically with the exception of our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section that is displayed on top of your alphabetically ordered card list. They are normally either those cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, you cannot manually edit or disable the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving this feature though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

I hope I was able to help you with your question.
Indien u verder nog vragen, suggesties ter verbetering of algemene feedback heeft, contacteer mij dan gerust opnieuw.

"Hi Karen,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm very sorry to hear that. 

In order to make scanning your loyalty cards into   as easy as possible, please ensure that you are in a sufficiently lighted environment first. In addition to that, please try not move the card while scanning it. I would recommend to put the card on a stable surface, for example a table. It might take a few seconds for the camera to focus on the barcode. If this is not working properly, you can also try to slightly move the camera back and forth until the camera focuses properly.

If the scanning screen does not open at all, there might be a problem with the permission to access your camera. Could you please double-check whether you gave   permission to access your camera? You can check this setting in your general system settings under "" "" -> ""Camera"" (iOS). Moreover, have you tried restarting your device yet? This might sound trivial but in many cases a simple phone restart can already solve these issues. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again. 

Best regards,

"Hallo Gerhard,

vielen Dank für Deine Nachricht und dafür, dass Du Dir die Zeit genommen hast, uns Rückmeldung zu geben. 

Leider beinhaltet die   Backup Funktion derzeit noch keine Synchronisation zwischen mehreren Geräten. Wir versuchen jedoch unsere App kontinuierlich zu verbessern und wissen, dass sich viele unserer Nutzer diese Funktion wünschen. Deswegen arbeiten wir bereits seit einiger Zeit an einer solchen Erweiterung des   Backups und hoffen, dass wir diese schon bald in unsere App integrieren können. In der Zwischenzeit entschuldigen wir uns vielmals für die Unannehmlichkeiten. 

Ich hoffe, ich konnte Dir bei Deiner Frage helfen. Solltest Du jedoch weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, kannst Du uns gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

"Ciao Antonio,

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible. 

Alternatively, you can also disable the notification badge completely in your general system settings under ""Notifications"" -> "" "" -> ""Badge App Icon"". 

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon.

"Hi Carra,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

Which flyers or catalogues you get displayed in your ""Offers"" section in   depends on the cards you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your   settings. Unfortunately, not all card providers decide to display their flyers or catalogues regularly. Moreover, some card providers don't want to show their catalogues in   at all. This is why it is possible that you don't receive offers for all of your added cards in  . On the other hand, some card providers decide to make their catalogues available to an entire region instead of only to their respective loyalty card holders. This is why you might see some offers for cards you don't have added. 

Furthermore, thank you very much for making us aware of this issue regarding the wrong unit being used to measure store distances in the US. This should of course be measured in yards or miles for the United States. I have already informed our developers about this mistake and we will try to correct it with one of our future updates. 

Moreover, I agree that our current system of greying out cards that have been selected in ordert to delete them might not be visible enough. I will definitely suggest to highlight selected cards better in the future. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this might cause.

Unfortunately, the Apple Wallet only supports a few barcode types (QR, Aztec, PDF 417 and Code 128 with iOS 9 or higher). You can add all your loyalty cards in   with barcodes of these formats to the Apple Wallet by clicking on the ""Share Card"" button at the bottom of the card display screen (below the barcode) and then choosing ""Add to Apple Wallet"". Since   supports many more barcode types, there might be cards in   that you cannot add to Apple Wallet. Therefore, these cards won't have an ""Add to Apple Wallet"" button.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. Unfortunately, I cannot explain why your   app would just disappear from your phone and I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case something like this happens again (or you reinstall the app or change your phone). You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under ""Backup"".

Unfortunately, it is not possible to automatically transfer your cards from the Beep'n'Go application to our   app. Since Beep'n'Go went out of business in May last year, their servers are most likely not active any longer. Therefore, I'm afraid, we cannot access them in order to export your card data. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

"Hi Myriam,

There indeed is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Best regards, Isabelle","3. 2. To transfer your data to another device:

"Hi Sheridan,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

"Hi Jasper,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Guten Tag Herr Wacker,

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben.

Uns ist bewusst, dass die Ladezeiten unserer App mit den letzten Updates beträchtlich gestiegen sind. Ich kann Ihnen jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits mit Hochdruck daran arbeiten, diese mit zukünftigen Updates wieder auf ein Minimum zu senken. Bis dahin könnten Sie als Übergangslösung versuchen,   während Ihres Einkaufs im Hintergrund geöffnet zu lassen. So muss die App nicht bei jedem Öffnen alle Notizen, Kartenbilder, Punktstände, etc. vollständig neu laden und die Ladezeiten sollten sich spürbar verringern. 

In der Zwischenzeit möchte ich mich aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen und hoffe, dass wir Ihnen   schon bald wieder in verbesserter Geschwindigkeit anbieten können.

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once.

Dziękujemy za skontaktowanie się z nami w tej sprawie! Niestety nie porozumiewam się w języku Polskie, więc mam nadzieję, że nie będzie problemem, jeśli odpowiem w języku angielskim:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

I'm afraid, it is currently not possible to change the entire card icon for your custom cards or to use the front and back pictures of a card from the ""Notes"" section as the icon on the   home screen. The original idea behind the quadratic (iOS) or circular (Android) shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. The front and back picture of your actual card can be stored in the ""Notes"" section of each instead. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their custom cards. We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your ""Other Cards"". Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Usually, you can add a new card to   the following way: 

1. Open the   App and click on the ""+""-button in the lower right corner of the screen.
2. Type in the name of your loyalty card's provider in the search field or scroll through the list. If you can't find the card you would like to include in the list, you can still add it to   by choosing to add it as ""Other card"".
3. Depending on the chosen loyalty card, either the barcode scanner, or a field to manually type in your customer ID will appear. 
4. Simply scan the barcode with your smartphone's camera or manually type in your customer ID. All done!

4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If I misunderstood you, please feel free to tell me about it.

"¡Hola Federico!

Muchas gracias por tomarte el tiempo para enviarnos tu sugerencia. Nos alegra mucho que te guste  .

Si tienes una tarjeta de Iberia plus que contiene un código QR puedes escanear este código en   y se va a generar del mismo formato en tu aplicación también. 
Lamentablemente no podemos garantizar que esto va a resolver el problema de escaneo ya que estos problemas ocurren principalmente debido a tecnologías de escaneo obsoletas que todavía usan algunas tiendas. Algunos dispositivos (por ejemplo, escáneres láser o escáneres de cama plana) tienen dificultades al leer pantallas de smartphones. Esperamos poder resolver este problema pronto, y que la mayoría de las tiendas reemplacen sus escáneres obsoletos por escáneres con una nueva tecnología, basada en imágenes, en el curso de su próxima actualización del sistema cajero. Hasta entonces, sería mejor pedirle al cajero que ingrese el número de la tarjeta manualmente en estos casos para que no se pierda ningún punto o descuento de recompensa.
En el caso de la tarjeta de Iberia también sería posible que el sistema cajero no reconoce el código de barras ya que la tarjeta actual contiene una banda magnética. En este caso, la mejor opción sería ingresar el número manualmente. 

Mientras tanto, me disculpo sinceramente por las molestias que esto ocasiona.

Una vez más, gracias por tomarte el tiempo para contactarnos. Espero que esta información te sea útil. Si tienes más preguntas o comentarios, no dudes en ponerte en contacto conmigo de nuevo.

Un saludo,

"Hi Brian,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue with your Costa card! That's indeed unusual! 

Do you mean the digital QR code in   didn't scan in store? Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. This might have also happened with your Costa card. 

We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always try to move the card back and forth in front of the scanning device a little and wait for a visible or audible feedback that your barcode has been picked up properly. In case it still doesn't work properly, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

"Hi Ryan,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Unfortunately, the Apple Wallet only supports a few barcode types (QR, Aztec, PDF 417 and Code 128 with iOS 9 or higher). You can add all your loyalty cards in   with barcodes of these formats to the Apple Wallet by clicking on the ""Share Card"" button at the bottom of the card display screen (below the barcode) and then choosing ""Add to Apple Wallet"". Since   supports many more barcode types, there might be cards in   that you cannot add to Apple Wallet. Therefore, these cards won't have an ""Add to Apple Wallet"" button. Please excuse the inconvenience. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

I'm afraid I'm not quite sure which password it is about. 
If you are referring to the PIN that is used to protect your   App with an additional lock screen, the solution depends on the operating system you are using   on. 
The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. In order to change it, you would need to do so in the general settings of your phone. 

If you are using   on an iOS device you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

Might it be possible that you are referring to the password of your   Backup account?
If you logged in via e-mail, you will find a ""Restore password/Forgot your password?"" button underneath the login button. We will then send you an email with a link to reset your password. 
For the login options Google+ and Facebook, the password of the associated accounts would need to be changed via your Google+/Facebook account. 

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Łukasz,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

There is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, please keep in mind that restoring a backup will overwrite all cards that were previously stored on the device. 

In case you only want to share selected cards with someone else, our Card Sharing feature might be the better choice. You can now share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps. All cards that can be shared now have a ""Share Card"" button below the barcode (iOS) or you can click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your card screen in order to open the menu bar and then choose ""Share"" (Android). 

By sharing a card, you will send a link that enables your friends or family to add your card to their own   app. Please keep in mind though that the link you send expires after a short amount of time due to data privacy issues and has to be send again if it is not opened in time. Please excuse the inconvenience.

"Ciao Carla,

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

If you would like to save a card in  , you can simply do so by scanning the barcode which is printed on your plastic card. It depends on each card whether this will be the back or front side of the card.
Furthermore, you also have the possibility to enter your customer number manually so you wouldn't need to scan your card. However, we can highly recommend using the barcode scanner since this will make it way easier and faster to enter all your cards and can also prevent from entering possible typos. 

The option which allows you to save a picture of the front and back side of your loyalty card in the ""Notes"" section is absolutely voluntary. This is an additional feature which allows you to carry all the card information without having to carry your plastic card.

I hope I could help to answer your question.

"Hi Mario,

Hartelijk dank dat u ons gecontacteerd heeft en de tijd neemt ons te vertellen over dit probleem!

Welke flyers of catalogi u ziet in uw 'Aanbiedingen'-sectie in   hangt af van de kaarten die u heeft toegevoegd, evenals de regio's die u heeft ingeschakeld in uw  -instellingen. Helaas besluiten niet alle kaartaanbieders hun flyers of catalogi regelmatig weer te geven. Bovendien willen enkele kaartaanbieders hun catalogi helemaal niet in   tonen. Dat is waarom het mogelijk is dat u geen aanbiedingen ontvangt voor al uw toegevoegde kaarten in  . Aan de andere kant kiezen sommige kaartaanbieders ervoor hun catalogi beschikbaar te maken voor een volledige regio in plaats van enkel voor hun respectievelijke loyaliteitskaarten. Dit is de reden dat u aanbiedingen kunt zien voor kaarten die u niet heeft toegevoegd. We bieden onze oprechte excuses aan voor het ongemak dat dit kan veroorzaken. 

Ik hoop dat deze informatie behulpzaam is voor u. Indien u verder nog vragen, suggesties ter verbetering of algemene feedback heeft, contacteer mij dan gerust opnieuw.

"Hi Ismael,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

The original idea behind the quadratic shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. The front and back picture of your actual card can be stored in the ""Notes"" section of each instead. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their custom cards. We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your ""Other Cards"". Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

"Hallo   Nutzer,

vielen Dank für Deine Nachricht und dafür, dass Du Dir die Zeit genommen hast, uns Rückmeldung zu geben.

Uns ist bewusst, dass die Ladezeiten unserer App mit den letzten Updates beträchtlich gestiegen sind. Ich kann Dir jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits mit Hochdruck daran arbeiten, diese mit zukünftigen Updates wieder auf ein Minimum zu senken. Bis dahin könntest Du als Übergangslösung versuchen,   während Deines Einkaufs im Hintergrund geöffnet zu lassen. So muss die App nicht bei jedem Öffnen alle Notizen, Kartenbilder, Punktestände, etc. vollständig neu laden und die Ladezeiten sollten sich spürbar verringern. 

In der Zwischenzeit möchte ich mich aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen und hoffe, dass wir Dir   schon bald wieder in verbesserter Geschwindigkeit anbieten können. 

Solltest Du weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, kannst Du Dich gerne jederzeit erneut bei mir melden.

"Hi Tom,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

I'm afraid, once you imported your cards from   to the Apple Wallet they are completely independent from their counterparts in  . This means these cards also have to be removed separately. In order to remove a card from the Wallet, please open the Wallet application via the app icon on your iPhone's home screen instead of via the shortcut from your lock screen. Now, please open your Nectar card in the Wallet and click on the little ""info"" button in the lower right corner of the screen. You should see the option to ""Remove Pass"" in the middle of the screen. 

Unfortunately, due to limitations imposed by Apple it is currently not possible to reorder your imported cards from   in the Apple Wallet. They will automatically get sorted in the order they were added. This means the last card you added will be the first card you see when you open the Apple Wallet. Therefore, I'm afraid, in order to sort your imported cards in   differently it would be necessary to remove all cards from the Wallet application first. Afterwards you can then add them again in your preferred order. Please excuse the inconvenience. 

Furthermore, scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. It's likely that this also happened wth your Nectar card at Sainsbury's. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

"Hi Denis,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to manually change the order of your cards in  . They will automatically get sorted alphabetically. However, you could us one of our integrated sorting tools. 

For   on Android devices, you can decide whether you prefer having your cards sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use or by last used. You can change this setting in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Sort card list by"".

For   on iOS devices we offer our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section which will be displayed on top of your card list. They are normally either those four cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, you cannot manually edit the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving these features though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Merci pour votre message! Malheureusement, mon français n'est pas si bon. J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas, mais je vais devoir poursuivre en anglais :

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

"Hi Laura,

Thank you for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

I'm happy to tell you that the feature to retrieve your current points balance via   is already available for selected cards. For those cards you will find a ""Points"" tab in your card screen next to your ""Notes"" tab. Before you can access your points via  , please make sure that your card is already registered on the respective card provider's homepage. The login credentials you chose there will then also be your login credentials to access this particular card account in  .
If this section should not show up on your cards, please make sure that your current region is enabled in the   Settings. I'm afraid this feature is not available for all cards in   yet. That's why it might be possible that you won't see this feature for every card. 

We are constantly trying to add more card providers to this feature with every update and hope that we can offer this service for all of your cards in the future. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

For   on Android devices, you can decide whether you prefer having your cards sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use or by last used. You can change this setting in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Sort card list by"".

Many thanks for your suggestion! 
Did you already know that you can search for a specific card by using the Google tool bar on your phone? Simply enter the name of the card you would like to open in   and choose to also search ""In Apps"". 

Unfortunately, we currently do not have such an own search function in   for Android devices yet. We are aware that this is something many users would like and will try to add it in one of our future updates. Until then, please excuse the inconvenience.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible. 

Alternatively, you can also disable the notification badge completely in your general system settings under ""Notifications"" -> "" "" -> ""Badge App Icon"" (iOS) or under ""Application Manager"" -> "" "" -> ""Notifications"" (Android). 

Please keep in mind though that you cannot delete or modify the ""Offers"" section in   since this section ensures that   is and will continue to be free of charge for our users.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - happy to help you with this! 

Our ""Offers"" section is of course completely voluntary and doesn't have to be used if you don't feel like it adds value to your shopping experience. To ensure that you won't be bothered by our offers in the future, I would recommend disabling the offer notifications in  . Depending on the operating system you are using you can do the following:

- iPhone:
You can turn off the push notifications for new offers in   by going to your iPhone's system settings, choosing ""Notifications"" -> "" "" and then disabling the push notifications for the   app.

- Android:
You can turn off the push notifications for new offers in   by going to the settings in the   app, choosing ""More"" and then disabling offer notifications or also by going to the general settings on your phone, choosing the ""Application Manager"" -> "" "" and then disabling the notifications for the   app there.

"Hi Ben,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

I'm afraid, the account you created on our website is for support purposes only. With this account, all support requests you sent to us will get saved and can be referred to later. 

However, there also is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Here you can create you backup account. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to your wife's device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your wife's device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your wife's device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. 
Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake. Therefore, please log out of your   Backup account on your device before you log into your account again on your wife's device. Furthermore, please notice that restoring a backup of your cards on your wife's device will replace all cards she had previously stored in her   app. 

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether it was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you for keeping me updated on this issue. I'm happy to hear that my explanation was understandable and you can now share your cards in   with your wife!

Please note though that the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no synchronization between your accounts. That's why, when you add a card on your device, it won't be automatically transferred to your wife's device.

"Hi Mark,

Thank you very much for the information and for your screenshots! 

Unfortunately, the ""Bad Request 400"" error is a problem with the   Backup login on very few iOS devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of this issue though and are currently trying to solve the problem as soon as possible. I am afraid you might not be able to log into your   Backup account until then. 

Are your cards currently still stored on your device and you wanted to create a backup? If this is the case, I'm happy to inform you that we have been working on changing our entire backup system and will release a new and improved version very soon in order to avoid such problems in the future. 

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again very soon.

"Hi Ine,

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

Unfortunately, some stores still use older scanning technologies (e.g. laser scanners or flat bed scanners) which oftentimes have difficulties scanning smartphone displays. It seems like Albert Heijn might be one of those stores but we hope to be able to solve this problem soon. Most stores will hopefully replace their outdated scanners with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

There is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Marouf,

Thank you very much for your suggestion to make it possible to change a card provider's logo on your   home screen!

At the moment, we have decided to automatically set the card provider's logo as the card icon for all cards that were added via our database of preset loyalty cards. The only exception are cards like Boots. However, we will definitely think about making it possible to change these card icons in the future. 

I'm happy to inform you though that it is already possible to create your own cards in  . Simply add the specific card as ""Other Card"". You will find the option to add a card as """"Other Card"" either right on top of the list of available card sin   or right below the ""Frequently Added"" cards. For your custom cards it is indeed possible to set your own card icon. In order to change the card icon, please choose to ""Edit"" the card and select ""Change Image"" (iOS) or ""Add Card Icon"" afterwards. This way, you can use the official Boots logo as the card icon for your Boots loyalty card in  .

"Guten Tag Herr Hollenstein,

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben. Bitte entschuldigen Sie die späte Antwort. 

Haben Sie auf Ihrem alten Gerät ein Backup Ihrer Karten über unsere   Backup Funktion erstellt? Dies ist derzeit leider die einzige Möglichkeit, wie Sie Ihre Karten in   auf ein zweites Smartphone übertragen können. Falls Sie ein Backup erstellt haben, teilen Sie mir bitte mit, welche Login Methode Sie dafür genutzt haben (Google, Facebook oder E-Mail Adresse). 

Sollten Sie noch kein Backup Ihrer Karten erstellt haben, so können Sie das auf folgende Weise tun:

Backup erstellen:
1. Bitte gehen Sie zu den Einstellungen in   und wählen Sie dann ""  Backup"" (Android) oder ""Backup"" (iOS). 
2. Nun können Sie sich entweder mit Facebook, Google oder einer privaten E-Mail Adresse einloggen. 
3. Ihre Karten sind gespeichert, sobald Sie erfolgreich angemeldet sind (iOS), oder Sie können danach auf ""Backup jetzt erstellen"" gehen (Android).

Karten auf einem anderen Gerät wiederherstellen:
1. Bitte gehen Sie wieder über die Einstellungen in   zum   Backup auf Ihrem neuen Handy.
2. Melden Sie sich mit denselben Daten an, wie auf dem alten Gerät (wenn Sie beispielsweise Google benutzt haben, bitte wieder über Google anmelden und nicht über E-Mail Adresse).
3. Sobald Sie angemeldet sind, werden Ihre Karten automatisch wiederhergestellt, oder es öffnet sich ein Fenster mit den Optionen entweder ein neues Backup anzulegen, oder ein altes Backup wiederherzustellen. Bitte wählen Sie die zweite Option aus (Backup wiederherstellen) und danach sollten alle Ihre Karten automatisch auf dem neuen Handy zur Verfügung stehen.

Bitte beachten Sie, dass einige Nutzer Probleme hatten, die Karten über Facebook wiederherzustellen. Ich empfehle daher, entweder Google, oder eine E-Mail Adresse zu verwenden, bis das Problem mit Facebook behoben ist. Des Weiteren würde ich Ihnen raten, darauf zu achten, dass Sie immer nur auf einem Gerät in Ihren   Backup Account eingeloggt sind und nicht auf mehreren Geräten gleichzeitig. 

Falls Sie möchten, dass wir überprüfen, ob Ihr Backup korrekt in unserer Cloud gespeichert wurde, können Sie uns gerne Ihre Login Option mitteilen, nachdem Sie Ihr Backup erstellt haben.

Ich kann Ihnen jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits darüber informiert sind und derzeit versuchen, das Problem schnellstmöglich zu beheben. Bis dahin kann es leider sein, dass es nicht möglich ist, ein Backup Ihrer Karten zu erstellen. Wir arbeiten jedoch derzeit daran, unser komplettes Backup System zu überarbeiten und werden Ihnen in Kürze eine verbesserte Version in   anbieten. 

In der Zwischenzeit entschuldigen wir uns aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten und hoffen, dass Sie   schon bald wieder in vollem Umfang auf all Ihren Geräten nutzen können.

Sollten Sie weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, können Sie uns gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

"Hi Tom,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Best regards,

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! Please excuse the delayed response. 

We are definitely aware that the current display of your imported cards from   in the Apple Wallet is not optimal yet. Unfortunately, due to limitations imposed by Apple it is currently very hard for our developers to conduct such changes within Apple's native applications such as the Wallet. Nevertheless, our team will try to find a better way to distinguish between your   cards in the Wallet for the future. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for contacting us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

I'm afraid, it is currently not possible to change the entire card icon for your custom cards or to use the front and back pictures of a card from the ""Notes"" section as the icon on the   home screen. The original idea behind the circular shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. The front and back picture of your actual card can be stored in the ""Notes"" section of each instead. For all cards that were added via our database, we have decided to use the overall card provider's logo as the card icon in   instead of the actual. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their cards in  . We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your cards on your   home screen. Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

However, I'm happy to tell you that it is already possible to change the description of your cards when you haver more than one card from the same provider. When you add a second card from the same card provider,   will automatically use ""2. card"" as the description you see in the card icon on your   home screen. If you now choose to ""Edit"" the card, you have the possibility to put something else as the ""Description"".

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I searched our servers and I was able to find a   Backup connected to your Google account daria.prandstraller@gmail.com though. I assume this is the backup you restored on your new device? Our servers show that you originally created this backup with 9 cards in November 2017. However, in December 2017 it was updated and contained only 8 cards afterwards. The last backup you created yesterday also contains these 8 cards. I believe the missing card from the first backup you created might be your Sigma card.

Which flyers or catalogues you get displayed in your ""Offers"" section in   depends on the cards you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your   settings. Unfortunately, not all card providers decide to display their flyers or catalogues regularly. Moreover, some card providers don't want to show their catalogues in   at all. This is why it is possible that you don't receive offers for all of your added cards in  . On the other hand, some card providers decide to make their catalogues available to an entire region instead of only to their respective loyalty card holders. This is why you might see some offers for cards you don't have added. 

Moreover, some companies have different catalogues for different regions within a country. Since you can currently only choose the overall country as your region in   and not a certain state or region within this country, it can happen that there is only one catalogue online which might not be the right one for your location. I can assure you that we are aware of the problem though and will try to differentiate between the states in the future.

Merci pour votre message! Malheureusement, mon français n'est pas si bon. J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas, mais je vais devoir poursuivre en anglais : Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, I'm not sure if I understood your comment correctly though. Are you having difficulties adding a new card to  ? Here is a step-by-step guide how you can add your loyalty cards to  :

1. Open the   App and click on the ""+""-button in the top right corner (iOS) or lower right corner (Android) of the screen.
2. Type in the name of your loyalty card's provider in the search field or scroll through the list. If you can't find the card you would like to include in the list, you can still add it to   by choosing to add it as ""Other card"".
3. Depending on the chosen loyalty card, either the barcode scanner, or a field to manually type in your customer ID will appear. 
4. Simply scan the barcode with your smartphone's camera or manually type in your customer ID. All done! 

In order to make scanning your loyalty cards into   as easy as possible, please ensure that you are in a sufficiently lighted environment first. In addition to that, please try not move the card while scanning it. I would recommend to put the card on a stable surface, for example a table. It might take a few seconds for the camera to focus on the barcode. If this is not working properly, you can also try to slightly move the camera back and forth until the camera focuses properly.

"Hi Ilyas,

Thank you very much for your screenshots! I now see that you were not referring to our   widget but rather to the imported cards in the Apple Wallet. I'm sorry I misunderstood you! 

Once you imported your cards to the Apple Wallet application they are completely independent from their counterparts in  . This means updating a card in   will not automatically update this card in the Wallet also. To get your updated card to the Wallet again it would therefore be necessary to remove the old card in the Wallet by clicking on the little ""info"" button in the lower right corner and then choosing to ""Remove Pass"". Now you can open the correct card in   and import it to your Apple Wallet again by choosing to ""Share Card"" -> ""Add to Apple Wallet"". 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Godfried,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I am happy to let you know that   does already support QR codes, among many other barcode types. Usually, all you need to do is scan the QR code on your plastic card with your phone's camera and   will generate a digital copy for you. 

In order to make scanning your loyalty cards into   as easy as possible, please ensure that you are in a sufficiently lighted environment first. In addition to that, please try not move the card while scanning it. I would recommend to put the card on a stable surface, for example a table. It might take a few seconds for the camera to focus on the barcode. If this is not working properly, you can also try to slightly move the camera back and forth until the camera focuses properly.

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions or adding your QR code to   is still not possible, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our idea!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

This information is partly correct I would say. We also try to provide you with the latest offers to your cards in  . You will find all available flyers, catalogues or coupons in your ""Offers"" section in  . However, not all card providers decide to provide us with their offers regularly. Moreover, some card providers don't want to show offers in   at all in order to push customers towards their own applications. Therefore, I'm afraid, you won't always find offers for all of your added cards in  . 

We still believe that having one app for all of your loyalty cards is so much more convenient than having to install every app for each store you like to shop in. Furthermore, we will definitely try to provide you with more offers or coupons for your cards in the future.

"Bonjour Yves,

Merci pour votre message! Malheureusement, mon français n'est pas si bon. J'espère que vous pouvez me comprendre.

Je suppose que vous avez déjà activé le ""  Card Assistant"" dans vos paramètres  ? Malheureusement, cette fonctionnalité n'est pas encore disponible pour toutes les cartes de  . C'est pourquoi il est possible que vous ne receviez pas de rappels pour toutes vos cartes ajoutées lorsque vous êtes à proximité de leurs magasins. Cependant, pour la version Android de  , la fonction Card Assistant peut apprendre du comportement de l'utilisateur. Cela signifie que si vous ouvrez par exemple une carte au même endroit, le Card Assistant s'en souviendra et vous rappellera d'utiliser votre carte de fidélité la prochaine fois que vous vous approcherez de cet emplacement spécifique. De cette façon, vous pouvez apprendre à Card Assistant l'emplacement de vos magasins préférés.

De plus, nous essayons d'ajouter plus de cartes et d'emplacements de magasins à cette fonctionnalité avec chaque mise à jour pour   et espérons que nous pourrons vous offrir ce service pour toutes vos cartes dans le futur. En attendant, nous nous excusons sincèrement pour le désagrément causé.

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

"Hi Angela,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, currently the problem is that some companies have different catalogues for different regions in Canada (e.g. different prices for ON and AB). Since you can currently only choose the overall region Canada and not a certain province within Canada, it can happen that there is only one catalogue online which might not be the right one for your location. For some cards we already try to localize your offers if you have location services enabled and gave   permission to access your location. I can assure you that we are aware of the problem though and will try to better differentiate between the provinces in the future.

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that we can provide you with more localized offers soon.

The   Lock on Android devices secures your cards with your device credentials.

I'm afraid, it is only possible to change the card icon for cards that were added as ""Other Cards"" to  . Simply choose to ""Edit"" the card and then you have the option to ""Add Card Icon"" (Android) or ""Change Image"" (iOS). Cards that were added via our database of preset card providers will automatically use the overall card providers logo as the card icon.

"Hi Riccardo,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us your suggestions to make it possible to group your cards in   into different folders and change a cards position in the card list!

We are always open to new ideas and really appreciate your message. We will discuss your ideas in detail and, if applicable, try to include these features in   in the future. In the meantime, you could try to use our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section which gets displayed on top of your card list. They are normally either those cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, it is not possible to manually change the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving this feature though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

"Hi Luke,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

I'm afraid, it is currently not possible to change the entire card icon for your custom cards or to use the front and back pictures of a card from the ""Notes"" section as the icon on the   home screen. The original idea behind the quadratic (iOS) or circular (Android) shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. The front and back picture of your actual card can be stored in the ""Notes"" section of each instead. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their custom cards. We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your ""Other Cards"". Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

Furthermore, I'm glad to inform you that you can also add cards which don't have any barcode. In these cases you would just need to enter the customer number manually.   will then additionally create a barcode. In order to increase the acceptance of such cards, we would recommend you to also save a picture of the front and back side of them. As I already mentioned, you can add these pictures in the ""Notes"" section.

"Hi Grace,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, it seems like there have been problems while scanning the cards from your device. 
These scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. Especially self service machines often use these kind of scanners. In this case, we would recommend you to rather use the usual cash desk in order to see whether this will work for you. Here you can also ask the store staff to type in the card number manually so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update.

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

"Hi Garey,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Michelle, 

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

I'm afraid, gift cards have not been officially added to our   app yet. Contrary to loyalty cards, gift cards are used as a method of payment and we currently cannot guarantee that they are going to be accepted in digital form. Whether or not a store will accept a digital copy of a gift card in   will depend on the particular store's policy. 
However, I'm glad to inform you that you can already add your Cineplex Scene card to  , if this is interesting for you. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would like such a feature in  . Therefore, we will definitely further investigate our possibilities regarding gift cards in   and try our best to make this possible in the future. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

I hope I was able to answer your question. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

"Bonjour Josée, 

Merci pour votre message!

En effet et malheureusement certains de nos utilisateurs ont des problèmes à faire scanner leur code-barres à la caisse d’un magasin de temps en temps. Ceci est dû au fait que certains magasins utilisent encore des anciens scanners basant sur une technologie de numérisation dépassée. Les scanners à laser par exemple, ont des difficultés à lire un affichage du smartphone.Heureusement, le nombre de ces situations diminue de jour en jour et bientôt tous les magasins auront adoptés les nouvelles technologies scanner. Pendant ce temps, il est aussi toujours possible de faire entrer le numéro de carte manuellement par l’hôte de caisse. Nous nous excusons pour la gêne occasionnée.

N’hésitez pas à nous recontacter pour toutes questions ou commentaires!

En attendant je vous souhaite une merveilleuse journée.

"Hi Sharon,

Thank you so much for getting in touch and suggesting new loyalty cards for our   App.

We will contact the card providers and will then try to add the cards in a future update for  . In the meantime, you can already add them as ""Other Cards"" to your   app. You will find the option to add a card as ""Other Card"" either right on top of the list of available card providers or directly below the ""Frequently Added"" cards. 

Which flyers or catalogues you get displayed in your ""Offers"" section in   depends on the cards you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your   settings. Some card providers decide to make their catalogues available to an entire region instead of only to their respective loyalty card holders. This is why you might see some offers for cards you don't have added. Unfortunately, it is not possible to delete or modify the ""Offers"" section, but its use is absolutely voluntary and you don't necessarily need to open offers that are not relevant to you.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Unfortunately, I don't speak Portuguese so I hope it's alright if I answer in English instead:

I'm afraid, the Apple Wallet only supports a few barcode types (QR, Aztec, PDF 417 and Code 128 with iOS 9 or higher). You can add all your loyalty cards in   with barcodes of these formats to the Apple Wallet by clicking on the ""Share Card"" button at the bottom of the card display screen (below the barcode) and then choosing ""Add to Apple Wallet"". Since   supports many more barcode types, there might be cards in   that you cannot add to Apple Wallet. Therefore, these cards won't have an ""Add to Apple Wallet"" button.

If you would like to restore your cards that have been saved in the   Backup, you can simply follow these steps: 

1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup""  on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup has been created successfully.

"Hallo Daniel,

vielen Dank für Deine Nachricht und dafür, dass Du Dir die Zeit genommen hast, uns Rückmeldung zu geben.

Uns ist bewusst, dass die Ladezeiten unserer App mit den letzten Updates beträchtlich gestiegen sind. Ich kann Dir jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits mit Hochdruck daran arbeiten, diese mit zukünftigen Updates wieder auf ein Minimum zu senken. Bis dahin könntest Du als Übergangslösung versuchen,   während Deines Einkaufs im Hintergrund geöffnet zu lassen. So muss die App nicht bei jedem Öffnen alle Notizen, Kartenbilder, Punktestände, etc. vollständig neu laden und die Ladezeiten sollten sich spürbar verringern. 

In der Zwischenzeit möchte ich mich aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen und hoffe, dass wir Dir   schon bald wieder in verbesserter Geschwindigkeit anbieten können. 

Solltest Du weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, kannst Du Dich gerne jederzeit erneut bei mir melden.

Beste Grüße

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

Unfortunately, our possibilities regarding the display of your imported cards from   in the Wallet application on your Apple Watch are rather limited since Apple restricts other developers from conducting changes within their native applications such as the Wallet. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

However, did you know that we offer our own   watch app? Contrary to the Wallet application on your watch, the   watch app will display your full barcode. In order to get the   app on your Apple Watch, simply open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and select to show the   app also on your watch. It will then get synchronized with   on your phone and automatically appear on your watch.

"Hi Benjamin,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, most of these scanning issues occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays in general. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners which can read phone screens in a matter of seconds in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always try to ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

Yes, it is indeed possible to share your cards in   with another   user. You can either share your entire card list by using our   Backup feature ore you can also share selected single cards by using our card sharing feature. 

The   Backup is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, please keep in mind that restoring a   Backup will replace all cards that were previously saved on the device where the backup is being restored. 

In case you don't want to share all of your cards our card sharing feature might be the better choice. With this feature you can share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps. All cards that can be shared now have a ""Share Card"" button below the barcode (iOS) or you can click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your card screen in order to open the menu bar and then choose ""Share"" (Android). 

By sharing a card, you will send a link that enables your friends or family to add your card to their own   app. Please keep in mind though that the link you send expires after a short amount of time due to data privacy issues and has to be send again if it is not opened in time. Please excuse the inconvenience. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any more questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

Yes, it is indeed possible to share your cards in   with another   user. You can either share your entire card list by using our   Backup feature ore you can also share selected single cards by using our card sharing feature. 

The   Backup is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.

To transfer your data to another device:

In case you don't want to share all of your cards our card sharing feature might be the better choice. With this feature you can share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm happy to help you with this!

Yes, we indeed offer an additional security feature to protect your cards in  ! Depending on the operating system you are using, you can enable it the following way:

- iPhone: 
If you are using an iPhone which has Touch ID enabled (available on iPhone 5S and later) you can use your unique fingerprint to protect all your rewards cards stored in  . To enable this feature, please open your   settings, go to ""Additional Settings"" and activate the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. In addition to your fingerprint,   will ask you to choose an at least 6-digit pin code as a backup option to access your cards for cases when your Touch ID does not work properly (e.g. when your hands are wet). 

- Android: 
If you are using   on an Android device you can enable the ""  Lock"" in your   settings under ""More"". If you enable the   Lock your cards in   will be secured with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your device from the lock screen will now also be the pin code to access your   app. To secure   with your fingerprint it would therefore be necessary to secure also your lock screen with your fingerprint. 

Please note that the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will only be available in your   settings if Touch ID is enabled and there is already a fingerprint stored in your iPhone settings under ""Touch ID & Passcode"". Similarly, you can only enable the ""  Lock"" feature in your settings in   if you use an unlock method to access your Android device from the lock screen. Please excuse the inconvenience.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Unfortunately, the Apple Wallet only supports a few barcode types (QR, Aztec, PDF 417 and Code 128 with iOS 9 or higher). You can add all your loyalty cards in   with barcodes of these formats to the Apple Wallet by clicking on the ""Share Card"" button at the bottom of the card display screen (below the barcode) and then choosing ""Add to Apple Wallet"". Since   supports many more barcode types, there might be cards in   that you cannot add to Apple Wallet. Therefore, these cards won't have an ""Add to Apple Wallet"" button.

"Hi Christl,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case something like this happens again (or you reinstall the app or change your phone). You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices).

Unfortunately, there seems to be a problem with displaying the correct points balance for PAM in   at the moment.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround.

There is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards on your old device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to your new device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

I hope I was able to help you. However, if you have any further questions or need further assistance with the   Backup feature, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Ameet,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

"Hi Ameet,

I am so sorry I misunderstood you!

In order to make scanning your loyalty cards into   as easy as possible, please ensure that you are in a sufficiently lighted environment first. In addition to that, please try not move the card while scanning it. I would recommend to put the card on a stable surface, for example a table. It might take a few seconds for the camera to focus on the barcode. If this is not working properly, you can also try to slightly move the camera back and forth until the camera focuses properly.

If the scanning screen does not open at all, there might be a problem with the permission to access your camera. Could you please double-check whether you gave   permission to access your camera? You can check this setting in your general system settings under "" "" -> ""Camera"". Moreover, have you tried restarting your device yet? This might sound trivial but in many cases a simple phone restart can already solve these issues. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

In vase you did not use this feature before I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case you reinstall the app or change your phone.

"Hi Jerry,

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

Which flyers or catalogues you get displayed in your ""Offers"" section in   depends on the cards you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your   settings. Unfortunately, not all card providers decide to display their flyers or catalogues regularly. I'm afraid, it seems like we have not received a new catalogue from Delhaize recently. However, we will try our best in order to bring it back soon. 

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Unfortunately it is not possible to create a copy of your cards in   and store them on a SD card or similar.

merci beaucoup pour votre message et d'avoir pris le temps de nous contacter à ce sujet! 

Nous sommes conscients que les temps de chargement actuels de notre application ont augmenté au cours des dernières mises à jour et nos développeurs travaillent sur l'amélioration de la vitesse de chargement et de la performance de l'application en général. Jusqu'à ce que s'améliore vous pourriez essayer de laisser   ouvert en arrière-plan de temps en temps pour éviter que l'application doit tout recharger à chaque fois que vous l'ouvrez.

"Guten Tag Herr Wezyk,

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben.

Uns ist bewusst, dass die Ladezeiten unserer App mit den letzten Updates beträchtlich gestiegen sind. Ich kann Ihnen jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits mit Hochdruck daran arbeiten, diese mit zukünftigen Updates wieder auf ein Minimum zu senken. Bis dahin könnten Sie als Übergangslösung versuchen,   während Ihres Einkaufs im Hintergrund geöffnet zu lassen. So muss die App nicht bei jedem Öffnen alle Notizen, Kartenbilder, Punktstände, etc. vollständig neu laden und die Ladezeiten sollten sich spürbar verringern. 

In der Zwischenzeit möchte ich mich aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen und hoffe, dass wir Ihnen   schon bald wieder in verbesserter Geschwindigkeit anbieten können.

"Hi Kimberly,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our app!

I'm afraid, the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no automatic synchronization between your accounts yet. That's why, when you add a card on one of your devices, it won't be automatically transferred to your second device, even if you use the same     Backup account on both devices. 

We are constantly trying to improve our app though and a synchronization feature is something we have already been working on for quite some time. I hope that we can include it to   soon. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this missing feature causes. 

However, if you did back up your cards before having to replace your phone it should be possible to restore this backup on another device now. I can check our Cloud and search for your backup if you like. If you used Facebook as the login option to your   Backup it is easier for us to find your account when we have your Facebook ID for  . You can find your Facebook ID the following way:

1. Please open your Facebook ""Settings"" on your computer by clicking on the little arrow symbol in the top right corner of your Facebook starting page and choosing ""Settings"".
2. Now, please select ""Apps"" in the left column.
3. Select "" "" and scroll down to ""Get Help from App Developers"".

"Hi Mehran,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it possible to access the app via Touch ID right now? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

Regarding your question about changing your device, I'm glad to inform you that there is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hi Marco,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

The original idea behind the quadratic (iOS) or circular (Android) shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their custom cards. We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your ""Other Cards"". Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once.

"Hi Elaine,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Best regards,

"Hi Cindy,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! That really is unusual!

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your download problem without further information. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to tell me which device you are using our   app on as well as the Android or iOS version it currently has installed. Moreover, would it be possible to provide us with a screenshot displaying the issue?

Many thanks and best regards,

"Hi Cindy,

Thank you for the information!

That is indeed unusual! Usually, the   app icon should simply be added to your home screen. Nevertheless, I'm happy to hear that the download was now finally possible. 

In case you experience any more problems with your   app, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

"Hallo Simon,

vielen Dank für das Vorschlagen der DHL Karte als neue Kundenkarte für unsere   App.

Wir werden den Kartenanbieter bezüglich einer Aufnahme kontaktieren und die Karte dann, wenn möglich, bei einem zukünftigen Update von   anbieten. In der Zwischenzeit kannst Du die Karte bereits jetzt als ""Andere Karte"" zu   hinzufügen. Die Option ""Andere Karte"" findest Du entweder ganz oben in der Liste der verfügbaren Kartenanbieter, oder direkt unter den ""Häufig Angelegten"" Karten. 

Falls Du weitere Fragen oder Anregungen hast, kannst Du mich gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren. 

Beste Grüße

"Hi Gerry,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. Your barcode ID always gets displayed below your barcode in  . 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or if I misunderstood you, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

"Bonjour Michel,

Merci pour votre message! Malheureusement, mon français n'est pas si bon. J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas, mais je vais devoir poursuivre en anglais:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are referring to the password to your   backup account, there is a ""Reset Password"" link underneath the login button. This will send a link to your mail address and you can reset your password. 
Unfortunately we cannot send this password reset link out via text message. Please excuse this inconvenience. 

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Muchas gracias por tu respuesta positiva. Nos alegra mucho que te guste   y que tomaste tiempo para darnos tu opinión.
Tu opinión es muy importante para nosotros, por lo cual vamos a discutir más en detalle sobre el diseño de tus tarjetas de la categoría ""Otra tarjeta"".

Espero que esto te será útil. Si tienes más preguntas o sugerencia, por favor, no dudes en contactarme de nuevo.

"Bonjour Philippe, 

Merci pour votre message!

En effet et malheureusement certains de nos utilisateurs ont des problèmes à faire scanner leur code-barres à la caisse d’un magasin de temps en temps. Ceci est dû au fait que certains magasins utilisent encore des anciens scanners basant sur une technologie de numérisation dépassée. Les scanners à laser par exemple, ont des difficultés à lire un affichage du smartphone.Heureusement, le nombre de ces situations diminue de jour en jour et bientôt tous les magasins auront adoptés les nouvelles technologies scanner. Pendant ce temps, il est aussi toujours possible de faire entrer le numéro de carte manuellement par l’hôte de caisse. Nous nous excusons pour la gêne occasionnée.

N’hésitez pas à nous recontacter pour toutes questions ou commentaires!

En attendant je vous souhaite une merveilleuse journée.

"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Unfortunately, I don't speak Japanese so I hope it is alright if I answer in English instead:

Unfortunately, this duplication of the card number when manually entering it seems to be a bug in   on iOS devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and are currently trying to solve it as soon as possible. 

Moreover, I will forward your feedback regarding the division of your card number in   to our developers. Maybe we can change this setting for future versions of our app!

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon.
