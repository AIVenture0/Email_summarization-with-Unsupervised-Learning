Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible. 

Alternatively, you can also disable the notification badge completely in your general system settings under ""Notifications"" -> "" "" -> ""Badge App Icon"". 

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon. 

Se doveste avere ulteriori domande, proposte per miglioramenti o commenti generali, non esitate a contattarmi di nuovo.

I checked our servers and I'm happy to tell you that I was able to find a   Backup account created via the ""Email"" login option and connected to your mail address nickvanbaelen@gmail.com. It was last updated in December 2017 and currently contains 20 cards. It is indeed very unusual that   would not restore your backup if your log into your   Backup email account now. 

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your problem without further information. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to tell me which device and operating system you are using our   app on. It would also be helpful to know which version of the   app you are currently running. To check your version, please go to your   settings and click on ""About"" (Android) or scroll to the end of the settings page (iOS).

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to manually change the order of your cards in  . They will automatically get sorted alphabetically. However, you could us one of our integrated sorting tools. 

For   on Android devices, you can decide whether you prefer having your cards sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use or by last used. You can change this setting in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Sort card list by"".

For   on iOS devices we offer our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section which will be displayed on top of your card list. They are normally either those four cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, you cannot manually edit the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving these features though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben. 

Dürfte ich Sie fragen, ob Sie noch Zugang zu   auf Ihrem alten Handy haben? Damit Sie Ihre Karten bei einem Gerätewechsel auf ein neues Handy übertragen können, müssen Sie zuvor ein Backup Ihrer Karten in   erstellen, welches Sie dann auf Ihrem neuen Handy wiederherstellen können. Dafür gibt es das   Backup, eine Funktion innerhalb der   App, die es Ihnen erlaubt, Ihre Karten in unserer Cloud zu sichern und auf ein weiteres mobiles Gerät zu übertragen. Dies funktioniert folgendermaßen:

Backup auf Ihrem alten Handy erstellen:
1. Bitte gehen Sie zu den Einstellungen in   und wählen Sie dann ""  Backup"" (Android) oder ""Backup"" (iOS). 
2. Nun können Sie sich entweder mit Facebook, Google oder einer privaten E-Mail Adresse einloggen. 
3. Ihre Karten sind gespeichert, sobald Sie erfolgreich angemeldet sind (iOS), oder Sie können danach auf ""Backup jetzt erstellen"" gehen (Android).

Karten auf Ihrem neuen Handy wiederherstellen:
1. Bitte gehen Sie wieder über die Einstellungen in   zum   Backup auf Ihrem neuen Handy.
2. Melden Sie sich mit denselben Daten an, wie auf dem alten Gerät (wenn Sie beispielsweise Google benutzt haben, bitte wieder über Google anmelden und nicht über E-Mail Adresse).
3. Sobald Sie angemeldet sind, werden Ihre Karten automatisch wiederhergestellt, oder es öffnet sich ein Fenster mit den Optionen entweder ein neues Backup anzulegen, oder ein altes Backup wiederherzustellen. Bitte wählen Sie die zweite Option aus (Backup wiederherstellen) und danach sollten alle Ihre Karten automatisch auf dem neuen Handy zur Verfügung stehen.

Bitte beachten Sie, dass einige Nutzer Probleme hatten, die Karten über Facebook wiederherzustellen. Ich empfehle daher, entweder Google oder eine E-Mail Adresse zu verwenden, bis das Problem mit Facebook behoben ist. Des Weiteren würde ich Ihnen raten, darauf zu achten, dass Sie Sich auf Ihrem alten Handy aus Ihrem Backup Account abmelden, bevor Sie Sich auf Ihrem neuen Handy in den selben Account einloggen. 

Ich würde Ihnen außerdem sehr empfehlen, ab sofort das   Backup zu nutzen, damit Sie Ihre Karten wiederherstellen können für den Fall, dass Sie die App deinstallieren oder das Smartphone wechseln. 

Ich hoffe, ich konnte Ihnen damit weiterhelfen. Falls etwas nicht funktioniert, oder Sie weitere Fragen haben, können Sie uns gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

May I ask you if you still have access to on your old phone? To transfer your cards to a new phone when you change devices, you must first create a backup of your cards, which you can then restore to your new phone. There's the backup, a feature within the app that allows you to back up your maps in our cloud and transfer them to another mobile device. This works as follows:

Create a backup on your old phone:
1. Please go to the settings in and then select (Android) or (iOS).
2. Now you can log in either with Facebook, Google or a private e-mail address.
3. Your maps are saved as soon as you are successfully logged in (iOS), or you can then go on (Android).

Restore maps on your new phone:
1. Please go back over the settings in to the backup on your new phone.
2. Log in with the same data as on the old device (for example, if you used Google, please log back in via Google and not via email address).
3. Once you are logged in, your maps will be restored automatically, or a window will open with the options to either create a new backup or restore an old backup. Please select the second option (restore backup) and then all your cards should be automatically available on the new phone.

Please note that some users had problems restoring the maps via Facebook. I therefore recommend using either Google or an email address until the problem with Facebook is resolved. Furthermore, I would advise you to make sure that you log out of your backup account on your old phone before you log in to the same account on your new phone.

I would also highly recommend using the backup now, so you can restore your maps in case you uninstall the app or change your smartphone.

I hope I could help you with that. If something does not work, or if you have further questions, feel free to contact us again at any time.

Thank you very much for the information! I'm sorry I misunderstood you at first!

It seems like you were previously running a rather old version of our app and now your   app got updated to the most recent version. We indeed changed our logo a couple of years ago from generic card image to the light red logo we use now. Hopefully you will enjoy our new design!

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our app!

I'm afraid, I'm not sure I understood your comment correctly. Usually, if   is opened it should indeed open your   home screen, which is your card list.

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases.

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. Se doveste avere ulteriori domande, proposte per miglioramenti o commenti generali, non esitate a contattarmi di nuovo.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, after changing phones you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. Unfortunately, backing up your device in general (e.g. via iCloud) won't save your card data in  . I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case you reinstall the app or change your phone. You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices). If you still have access to   on your old phone you can still create a backup of your cards and transfer them to your new device.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with our   Backup feature, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, after changing phones you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. Unfortunately, backing up your device in general (e.g. via iCloud) won't save your card data in  . I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case you reinstall the app or change your phone. You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices). If you still have access to   on your old phone you can still create a backup of your cards and transfer them to your new device.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with our   Backup feature, please don't hesitate to contact me again.","Best regards,

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns diesbezüglich zu kontaktieren. 

Leider muss ich Ihnen mitteilen, dass es uns nicht möglich ist, Ihre Karten aus der Vodafone Wallet App in die   App zu importieren. Das liegt vor allem daran, dass wir keinen Zugriff auf die Daten aus anderen Apps haben. Sie haben jedoch die Möglichkeit, Ihre Kartennummern in   manuell einzugeben, anstatt den Barcode auf Ihrer tatsächlichen Plastikkarte zu scannen. Auf diese Weise müssen Sie nicht extra alle Plastikkarten erneut suchen. Wir entschuldigen uns dennoch vielmals für die Unannehmlichkeiten, die Ihnen dadurch entstehen. 

Sollten Sie weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, können Sie uns gerne jederzeit erneut konatktieren.

Unfortunately, I have to tell you that we can not import your maps from the Vodafone Wallet app into the app. This is mainly because we do not have access to data from other apps. However, you can manually enter your card numbers instead of scanning the barcode on your actual plastic card. This way, you do not have to search all plastic cards again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

I'm afraid, this problem seems to be related to the resolution of your device. Unfortunately, it seems like the Wileyfox Swift is reporting a wrong pixel density to   which leads to our app assuming an incorrect display size. We always try to create barcodes that can be scanned easily from short distance instead of simply creating the biggest barcode possible.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.","Best regards,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your problem without further information. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to tell me which device and operating system you are using our   app on. It would also be helpful to know which version of the   app you are currently running. To check your version, please go to your   settings and click on ""About"" (Android) or scroll to the end of the settings page (iOS). 

May I ask what happens when you try to log out of your Nectar card account? Is the logout button not responding? This might sound trivial but have you tried restarting your device yet? Oftentimes a simple phone restart can already help resolving such issues. Could you please try this and let me know if it's possible to log out now? If you can log out, please do so and log in again afterwards. This should force your points balance to get updated. 

Many thanks and best regards,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores, irrespective of the barcode size. We create all barcodes in   in a size that can easily be scanned from a short distance. However, some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. Beep'n'Go was able to avoid this problem by using the so-called Samsung Beaming Service. This technology transfers the barcode from your phone's screen directly into the scanner via NFC, thus making it possible to use digital barcodes also with older scanning devices. Since we are aware that Beep'n'Go went out of business last year, we have already reached out to Samsung in order to make their beaming service available in   instead. Unfortunately, Samsung currently restricts the usage of their technology for third parties. Therefore, I'm afraid, we cannot offer your barcode beaming in   at the moment. 

Nevertheless, we hope to be able to solve this problem soon as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

The reason for this is most likely that you are manually entering the card number which is printed on the front side of the card. However, in order to create a valid barcode   needs the barcode ID. There should be a barcode on the back of your physical Club Vips card. The easiest way would be to simply scan this barcode with your phone's camera. However, you can of course also manually enter the barcode iD which is printed below the barcode. After your card has been properly added,   will display both your barcode ID and customer number.

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.","Hi   user,"

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. Beep'n'Go was able to avoid this problem by using the so-called Samsung Beaming Service. This technology transfers the barcode from your phone's screen directly into the scanner, thus making it possible to use digital barcodes also with older scanning devices. Since we are aware that Beep'n'Go went out of business last year, we have already reached out to Samsung in order to make their beaming service available in   instead. Unfortunately, Samsung currently restricts the usage of their technology for third parties. Therefore, I'm afraid, we cannot offer your barcode beaming in   at the moment. 

Nevertheless, we hope to be able to solve this problem soon as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, after reinstalling   you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. However, all your accumulated loyalty points are still saved in your card accounts. Nevertheless, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case something like this happens again (or you reinstall the app or change your phone). You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices).

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, please make sure to log out of your   Backup account on your device first before you log in on your wife's device in order to restore your cards.

I'm afraid, the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no synchronization between your accounts. That's why, when you add a card on one of your devices, it won't be automatically transferred to your second device.

Hartelijk dank dat u ons gecontacteerd heeft en de tijd heeft genomen om ons feedback te geven! Het wordt zeer gewaardeerd!

Helaas treden deze scanproblemen voornamelijk op vanwege oudere scantechnieken die nog steeds gebruikt worden door enkele winkels. Enkele toestellen (bijv. laserscanners of flatbedscanners) hebben problemen smartphoneschermen af te lezen. Echter, we hopen dit probleem snel te verhelpen aangezien de meeste winkels hopelijk deze scantoestellen vervangen door nieuwere, op afbeeldingen gebaseerde scanners bij hun volgende kassasysteem-update. Tot die tijd lijkt het het beste om het winkelpersoneel te vragen het kaartnummer met de hand in te voeren in deze gevallen zodat u geen beloningspunten of kortingen mist. 

In de tussentijd bieden we onze oprechte excuses aan voor het ongemak dat dit veroorzaakt.

Unfortunately, these scanning problems mainly occur due to older scanning techniques that are still used by a few stores. Some devices (such as laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have problems reading smartphone screens. However, we hope to resolve this issue quickly as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer, image-based scanners with their next checkout system update. Until then, it would be best to ask store staff to enter the card number manually in these cases so that you do not miss any reward points or discounts.

95,"Hi Rodriguez,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. Unfortunately, backing your phone up via iCloud won't save your card data in  . I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case something like this happens again (or you reinstall the app or change your phone). You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices).

If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Best regards,

96,"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

98,"Hi Jon,

Thank you very much for your screenshots!

I checked the barcode on your Tesco Clubcard and consulted one of our developers to ensure I give you the correct information about this. It seems like the barcode on your physical card indeed contains a lot more information than only your individual card number. Our team is currently working on converting the characters that appear after scanning your card into your Tesco Clubcard number. However, in the meantime your card is still valid and usable if your simply save the scanned input without conducting any changes on it. Since you card number is not yet displayed below your digital Tesco barcode, I would recommend to store a front picture of your physical card in the ""Notes"" section in   so that you also have your card number at hand when you need it. 

Please excuse the confusion. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Hartelijk dank dat u ons gecontacteerd heeft en de tijd heeft genomen om ons feedback te geven! Het wordt zeer gewaardeerd! 

We zijn ons ervan bewust dat de laadtijden van onze app bij de laatste updates zijn toegenomen en ik kan u verzekeren dat onze ontwikkelaars er reeds aan werken om de snelheid en algemene prestaties weer te verbeteren voor toekomstige updates. Tot die tijd kunt u als tijdelijke oplossing proberen   geopend te houden op de achtergrond terwijl u winkelt. Op deze manier hoeft de app al uw informatie niet helemaal opnieuw te laden (bijv. kaartfoto's, puntensaldo's etc.) iedere keer dat de app geopend wordt en zullen de laadtijden significant verminderen. 

In de tussentijd bieden we onze oprechte excuses aan voor het ongemak dat dit veroorzaakt en hopen we dat u   snel weer op volle kracht kunt gebruiken.

Did you know that there is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device? With the   Backup you can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either   or  . Please select   and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.","Hi Jaimie,"

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

We are aware that the current loading times of our app have increased over the course of the latest updates and I can assure you that our developers are already working on improving the speed and overall performance again for future releases. Until then, you could try keeping   opened in the background while shopping as a temporary workaround. This way, the app doesn't have to reload all your information (e.g. card pictures, points balances, etc.) completely each time it is opened and the loading times will be decreased significantly. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full capacity again soon.

vielen Dank für die Informationen zu Deinen Geräten. 

Leider gibt es derzeit auf einigen wenigen iPhone Geräten ein Problem mit dem Login zum   Backup. Es scheint, als würde dieser Fehler auch auf Deinem iPhone 4S passieren. Ich kann Dir jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits darüber informiert sind und derzeit versuchen, das Problem schnellstmöglich zu beheben. Bis dahin ist es leider nicht möglich sich beim   Backup anzumelden.

Unser nächstes Update befindet sich jedoch schon fast in der Betatest-Phase. Es wird also nicht mehr allzu lange dauern, bis das   Backup wieder fehlerfrei zu benutzen ist. Falls Du Deine Kartendaten in   jedoch sofort übertragen möchtest, wäre die andere Möglichkeit, ein iTunes Backup Deines alten iPhones über Deinem Computer zu erstellen und dieses dann auf dem iPhone 7 wiederherzustellen.

Unfortunately there is currently a problem with the login to backup on a few iPhone devices. It seems like this mistake will happen on your iPhone 4S as well. However, I can assure you that our developers are already aware of this and are currently trying to fix it as soon as possible. Until then, it is unfortunately not possible to log in to the backup.

However, our next update is almost in beta testing. So it will not be too long before the backup will be free of errors. However, if you want to transfer your map data to immediately, the other option would be to create an iTunes backup of your old iPhone from your computer and then restore it to iPhone 7. Unlike a backup via iClou, an iTunes backup also backs up your maps into.

Nevertheless, we apologize for the inconvenience and hope that you can use it again soon.

110,"Hi Jose,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Unfortunately, I don't speak Portuguese so I hope it is alright if I answer in English instead:

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. This might also be the case at the Continente store. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update.

Moreover, I think the duplicates you mentioned could be another feature of our app. Usually, we will show four of your cards in our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section on top of your card list for fast and easy access. They are normally either those cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). If you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Moreover, I think the duplicates you mentioned could be another feature of our app. Usually, we will show four of your cards in our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section on top of your card list for fast and easy access. They are normally either those cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). If you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. Additionally, these cards will still be shown in your usual alphabetical card list. Please excuse the inconvenience.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

The reason for this is that our   watch app for Android Wear is not a standalone app but rather gets synchronized with   on your Android Phone. 

In order to get   running on your watch it is therefore necessary to sync   on your smartwatch with your   phone app. To do that, please make sure that your watch as well as the   phone app and the Android Wear app on your phone have all available updates installed. Now, please open the Android Wear app on your phone, click on the ""Settings Gear"", select your watch and click ""Resync apps"". After these steps, the   watch app should be available again.

Alternatively, for Android Wear 2.0 devices it should also be possible to open the Google Play Store on your watch and scroll to the very bottom of the page. Here you should find a section called ""Apps from my Phone"" where you should also find the   app. 

Please note that the sync process might take some time. However, when the process is finished the   watch app will automatically appear on your smartwatch.

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our idea! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, the problem is that some companies have different catalogues for different regions in Australia (e.g. different prices for NSW and QLD). Since you can currently only choose the region Australia and not a certain state or region within Australia, it can happen that there is only one catalogue online which might not be the right one for your location. I can assure you that we are aware of the problem though and will try to differentiate between the states in the future. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that we can provide your with better localized offers very soon.

Furthermore, I'm happy to tell you that such a reminder feature already exists. The   Card Assistant is a feature in   which accesses your current location in order to remind you to use your loyalty cards when you are near selected stores. Moreover, via the Card Assistant notification you receive, it is possible to directly access the corresponding loyalty card via the lock screen without having to open the   app first. You will find the Card Assistant in your settings in   under ""  Card Assistant"" (Android) or ""Card Assistant"" (iOS).

Unfortunately, this feature is not available for all listed cards in   yet. We try to add more cards and store locations to this feature with every new update though and hope that we can offer this service for all your cards in the future.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. This might also be the case at Woolworths. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no synchronization between your accounts. That's why, when you add a card on one of your devices, it won't be automatically transferred to your second device. We are constantly trying to improve our app though and a synchronization feature is something we have already been working on for quite some time. I hope that we can include it to   soon. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this missing feature causes. 

However, it should still be possible to restore your backup on your tablet. Usually, to transfer your data to another device you need to follow the steps below:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

I hope I was able to help you but in case the restore is still not working properly, please don't hesitate to contact me again. 

Met vriendelijke groeten,

We are constantly trying to improve our app though and a synchronization feature is something we have already been working on for quite some time. I hope that we can include it to   soon. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this missing feature causes. 

However, it should still be possible to restore your backup on your tablet. Usually, to transfer your data to another device you need to follow the steps below:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

vielen Dank für Deinen Vorschlag, den Mitgliedsausweis des Deutschen Alpen Vereins als neue Karte zu unserer   App hinzuzufügen.

Wir werden den Kartenanbieter bezüglich einer Aufnahme kontaktieren und die Karte dann, wenn möglich, bei einem zukünftigen Update von   anbieten. In der Zwischenzeit kannst Du die Karte bereits jetzt als ""Andere Karte"" zu   hinzufügen. Die Option ""Andere Karte"" findest Du entweder ganz oben in der Liste der verfügbaren Kartenanbieter, oder direkt unter den ""Häufig Angelegten"" Karten. 

Falls Du weitere Fragen oder Anregungen hast, kannst Du mich gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

Merci pour votre message! Malheureusement, mon français n'est pas si bon. J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas, mais je vais devoir poursuivre en anglais :

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, it can sometimes happen that you get logged out of your points accounts, e.g. when the app gets updated. However, it should be possible to simply log into your Intermarché account again and get you points displayed again. Please excuse the inconvenience.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to manually change the order of your cards in   or mark some cards as your favorites. They will automatically get sorted alphabetically. However, you could us one of our integrated sorting tools. 

For   on Android devices, you can decide whether you prefer having your cards sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use or by last used. You can change this setting in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Sort card list by"".

For   on iOS devices we offer our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section which will be displayed on top of your card list. They are normally either those four cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, you cannot manually edit the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving these features though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Moreover, the original idea behind the circular shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. The front and back picture of your actual card can be stored in the ""Notes"" section of each instead. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their custom cards. We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your ""Other Cards"". Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Thank you so much for your suggestions! 

I'm happy to inform you that it is already possible to share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps. All cards that can be shared now have a ""Share Card"" button below the barcode (iOS) or you can click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your card screen in order to open the menu bar and then choose ""Share"" (Android). 

By sharing a card, you will send a link that enables your friends or family to add your card to their own   app. Please keep in mind though that the link you send expires after a short amount of time due to data privacy issues and has to be send again if it is not opened in time.

166,"Hi Ria, 

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. Beep'n'Go was able to avoid this problem by using the so-called Samsung Beaming Service. This technology transfers the barcode from your phone's screen directly into the scanner, thus making it possible to use digital barcodes also with older scanning devices. Since we are aware that Beep'n'Go went out of business last year, we have already reached out to Samsung in order to make their beaming service available in   instead. Unfortunately, Samsung currently restricts the usage of their technology. Therefore, I'm afraid, we cannot offer your barcode beaming in   at the moment. 

Nevertheless, we hope to be able to solve this problem soon as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your problem without further information.

178,"Hi Kent,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

I'm afraid, there is always only one copy of your cards stored in our   Cloud. This means each new backup you create with the same   Backup account will automatically overwrite your previously stored backup. Did you log into your   Backup account and created a new backup when you opened   on your old phone? Once a backup as been overwritten because a new backup was created there is no way to restore the previous backup. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

However, I'm happy to inform you that we are currently working on changing and improving our entire backup system so that your cards will continuously get synchronized instead of only storing a one-time copy. Hopefully, we can offer you this improved service very soon. 

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

This indeed sounds very unusual! Unfortunately, it is very hard for me to make a valid statement about whether or not your first gym barcode was digitized properly without seeing the original card first. Do you by any chance still have the original membership card? Oftentimes these scanning issues also occur due to older scanning devices (e.g. laser scanners) still being used.

181,"¡Hola Carmen!

Muchas gracias por contactarnos por este asunto y enviarnos tu comentario.

¿Te podría preguntar que pasa exactamente si quieres usar   en la tienda de Día? ¿Hay problemas al escanear la tarjeta?
Los problemas de escaneo ocurren principalmente debido a tecnologías de escaneo obsoletas que todavía usan algunas tiendas. Algunos dispositivos (por ejemplo, escáneres láser o escáneres de cama plana) tienen dificultades para leer pantallas de smartphones. Esperamos poder resolver este problema pronto, y que la mayoría de las tiendas reemplacen sus escáneres obsoletos por escáneres con una nueva tecnología, basada en imágenes, en el curso de su próxima actualización del sistema cajero. Hasta entonces, sería mejor pedirle al cajero que ingrese el número de la tarjeta manualmente en estos casos para que no se pierda ningún punto o descuento de recompensa.

Mientras tanto, me disculpo sinceramente por las molestias que esto ocasiona.

Una vez más, gracias por tomarte el tiempo para contactarnos. Espero que esta información te sea útil. 
Me gustaría mucho recibir otro mensaje de tu parte en caso de que tengas otra pregunta o sugerencia para nosotros.

Could I ask you what exactly happens if you want to use it in the Day store? Are there problems when scanning the card?
Scanning problems occur mainly due to outdated scanning technologies that some stores still use. Some devices (for example, laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulty reading smartphone screens. We hope to solve this problem soon, and that most stores replace their obsolete scanners with scanners with a new technology, based on images, in the course of their next update of the ATM system. Until then, it would be better to ask the cashier to enter the card number manually in these cases so that no reward point or discount is lost.

Meanwhile, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Once again, thanks for taking the time to contact us. I hope this information is useful for you.
I would very much like to receive another message from you in case you have another question or suggestion for us.

vielen lieben Dank, dass Sie mir Ihren Screenshot erneut zugesendet haben. 

Es ist in der Tat ungewöhnlich, dass Sie diese Fehlermeldung bekommen. Auf unseren Test Geräten ist die Backup Erstellung weiterhin fehlerfrei möglich, daher handelt es sich nicht um ein allgemeines Server Problem. Ich würde Sie bitten, einmal in die allgemeinen Einstellungen Ihres Geräts zu gehen und den ""Anwendungsmanager"" zu öffnen. Suchen Sie hier bitte nach   und leeren Sie dann unter ""Speicher"" den Cache der App. Starten Sie Ihr Gerät nun bitte einmal neu. Das mag zunächst trivial klingen, jedoch kann ein Geräteneustart bei solchen Probleme häufig bereits Abhilfe schaffen. 

Haben Sie die Erstellung Ihres Backups bisher nur mit WLAN-Verbindung versucht, oder auch schon mit mobiler Datennutzung? Haben Sie die selbe oder eine andere E-Mail Adresse benutzt, bei dem Versuch einBackup über E-Mail zu nutzen?

Vielen Dank und beste Grüße,

It is indeed unusual for you to get this error message. On our test devices, the backup creation is still possible error-free, so it is not a general server problem. I would ask you to go into the general settings of your device and open it. Please search here and then empty the app's cache. Please restart your device once. This may sound trivial at first, but restarting the device can often help with such problems.

So far, have you tried to create your backup only with a Wi-Fi connection, or even with mobile data usage? Did you use the same or a different email address when trying to use a backup via email?

Usually, if the ""Lock with Touch ID"" features is activated it should be possible to access your   app with either your fingerprint or the passcode you chose. However, Touch ID oftentimes fails, e.g. if your hands are wet or if you used hand lotion.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, it is very hard for us to detect the source of your problem without further information. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to tell me which device you are using our   app on and which Android or iOS version it is currently running. It would also be helpful to know which version of the   app you are currently running. To check your version, please go to your   settings and click on ""About"" (Android) or scroll to the end of the settings page (iOS). 

Usually, the only screen light setting we do have enabled in   is that we will auto-adjust your screen brightness to the maximum level when a card is opened. The reason for this setting is that is makes the scanning process in store easier. However, as soon as the card is closed again, your screen brightness will return to its previous level. 

Would it be possible for you to send us a screenshot of what exactly happens so that our developers can take a look?

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

The flyers or catalogs that appear in your section depend on the maps you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your configurations. Unfortunately, not all card providers regularly display their flyers or catalogs. In addition, some card providers do not wish to show their catalogs at all in. This is why you may not receive offers for all cards added in.

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment.

3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

The flyers or catalogs that appear in your section depend on the maps you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your configurations. Unfortunately, not all card providers regularly display their flyers or catalogs. In addition, some card providers do not wish to show their catalogs at all in. This is why you may not receive offers for all cards added in.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us your suggestion to make it possible to change the position of the barcode in   so that you can also use it at stationary scanners!

We are always open to new ideas and really appreciate your message. We will discuss the idea in detail and, if applicable, try to include such a feature in   in the future. In the meantime, we apologize for the inconvenience. 

Until then, there might already be a workaround in case you are using   on an iPhone. On iPhone devices you can enable the so-called one hand mode in your system settings under ""General"" -> ""Accessibility"" -> ""Reachability"". If you now open your card in   and double tap (not press) the home button, the top half of your screen will be brought down to the middle of the display, resulting in the barcode being displayed at the very bottom of the screen. This way, it should be possible to use your digital cards in   also at stationary scanners.

I'm afraid, the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no synchronization between your accounts. That's why, when you add a card on one of your devices, it won't be automatically transferred to your second device. Due to this limitations we would advise you to log out of your   Backup account on your main device after you created your backup. Then you can log into the same account on the second device and choose to restore your cards.

It's indeed unusual that you don't receive any offers! This might sound trivial but have you tried restarting your device yet? Oftentimes a simple phone restart can already help solving such issues!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

Welke flyers of catalogi u ziet in uw 'Aanbiedingen'-sectie in   hangt af van de kaarten die u heeft toegevoegd, evenals de regio's die u heeft ingeschakeld in uw  -instellingen. Helaas besluiten niet alle kaartaanbieders hun flyers of catalogi regelmatig weer te geven. Bovendien willen enkele kaartaanbieders hun catalogi helemaal niet in   tonen. Dat is waarom het mogelijk is dat u geen aanbiedingen ontvangt voor al uw toegevoegde kaarten in  .

Hartelijk dank dat u ons gecontacteerd heeft en de tijd neemt ons te vertellen over dit probleem!

Welke flyers of catalogi u ziet in uw 'Aanbiedingen'-sectie in   hangt af van de kaarten die u heeft toegevoegd, evenals de regio's die u heeft ingeschakeld in uw  -instellingen. Helaas besluiten niet alle kaartaanbieders hun flyers of catalogi regelmatig weer te geven. Bovendien willen enkele kaartaanbieders hun catalogi helemaal niet in   tonen. Dat is waarom het mogelijk is dat u geen aanbiedingen ontvangt voor al uw toegevoegde kaarten in  . Aan de andere kant kiezen sommige kaartaanbieders ervoor hun catalogi beschikbaar te maken voor een volledige regio in plaats van enkel voor hun respectievelijke loyaliteitskaarten. Dit is de reden dat u aanbiedingen kunt zien voor kaarten die u niet heeft toegevoegd. We bieden onze oprechte excuses aan voor het ongemak dat dit kan veroorzaken. 

Afhankelijk van het besturingssysteem dat u gebruikt kunt u het volgende doen: 

- iPhone:

Which flyers or catalogs you see in your 'Offers' section depends on the maps that you have added, as well as the regions that you have enabled in your settings. Unfortunately, not all card providers decide to display their flyers or catalogs regularly. Moreover, some card providers do not want to display their catalogs at all. That is why it is possible that you will not receive offers for all your added cards in. On the other hand, some card providers choose to make their catalogs available for an entire region rather than just for their respective loyalty cards. This is the reason that you can see offers for cards that you have not added. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Depending on the operating system you use, you can do the following:

- iPhone:
You can disable push notifications for new offers by going to your iPhone's system settings, choosing 'Notifications' -> '' and then turning off the push notifications for the app.

- Android:
You can disable push notifications for new offers by going to the settings in the app, choosing 'More' and then disabling offer notifications or by going to general settings of your phone, choosing the 'Application manager' -> '' and then turn off the app's notifications.

Thank you very much for the information!

Is it still possible to access   via your Touch ID? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, the Apple Wallet only supports a few barcode types (QR, Aztec, PDF 417 and Code 128 with iOS 9 or higher). You can add all your loyalty cards in   with barcodes of these formats to the Apple Wallet by clicking on the ""Share Card"" button at the bottom of the card display screen (below the barcode) and then choosing ""Add to Apple Wallet"". Since   supports many more barcode types, there might be cards in   that you cannot add to Apple Wallet. Therefore, these cards won't have an ""Add to Apple Wallet"" button. 

Moreover, the original idea behind the quadratic shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon. The remainder of the icon will then automatically adjust its color to the color on the outer border of your chosen picture so that the icons for your ""Other Cards"" look similar to the ones we automatically set for cards that were added via our database. The front and back picture of your actual card can be stored in the ""Notes"" section of each instead. 

We are aware though that a lot of our users would appreciate more control over the design of the card icons for their custom cards. We take the direct feedback from our users very seriously and will work on a better solution for the display of your ""Other Cards"". Hopefully we can change the current setting for future releases of  . In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this setting causes.

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

Moreover, the notification alert on the   app icon usually indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible.

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

There is indeed a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards on your device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on the other device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, please log out of your backup account on your device first before you try to log into the same account on another device.

We are definitely aware that the load times of our app have risen considerably with the latest updates. However, I can assure you that our developers are working hard to reduce them to a minimum with future updates. Until then, as an interim solution, you may want to keep it open in the background while shopping. Thus, the app does not have to reload all notes, map images, scores, etc. completely each time and load times should be noticeably reduced.

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and hope that we can soon offer you at an improved speed.

If you have further questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me any time.

Yours sincerely,","Guten Tag Herr Opitz,"

Building a watch app for Tizen devices is definitely on our agenda!

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! 

If you are using   on an iPhone, your cards will automatically get sorted alphabetically with the exception of our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section that is displayed on top of your alphabetically ordered card list. They are normally either those cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, you cannot manually edit or disable the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving this feature though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

I hope I was able to help you with your question.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm very sorry to hear that. 

In order to make scanning your loyalty cards into   as easy as possible, please ensure that you are in a sufficiently lighted environment first. In addition to that, please try not move the card while scanning it. I would recommend to put the card on a stable surface, for example a table. It might take a few seconds for the camera to focus on the barcode. If this is not working properly, you can also try to slightly move the camera back and forth until the camera focuses properly.

If the scanning screen does not open at all, there might be a problem with the permission to access your camera. Could you please double-check whether you gave   permission to access your camera? You can check this setting in your general system settings under "" "" -> ""Camera"" (iOS). Moreover, have you tried restarting your device yet? This might sound trivial but in many cases a simple phone restart can already solve these issues.

Leider beinhaltet die   Backup Funktion derzeit noch keine Synchronisation zwischen mehreren Geräten.

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

Which flyers or catalogues you get displayed in your ""Offers"" section in   depends on the cards you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your   settings. Unfortunately, not all card providers decide to display their flyers or catalogues regularly. Moreover, some card providers don't want to show their catalogues in   at all. This is why it is possible that you don't receive offers for all of your added cards in  . On the other hand, some card providers decide to make their catalogues available to an entire region instead of only to their respective loyalty card holders. This is why you might see some offers for cards you don't have added. 

Furthermore, thank you very much for making us aware of this issue regarding the wrong unit being used to measure store distances in the US. This should of course be measured in yards or miles for the United States. I have already informed our developers about this mistake and we will try to correct it with one of our future updates. 

Moreover, I agree that our current system of greying out cards that have been selected in ordert to delete them might not be visible enough. I will definitely suggest to highlight selected cards better in the future. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this might cause.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm really sorry to hear that!

I'm afraid, you can only restore your cards if you made a backup via the   Backup feature beforehand. Otherwise, your card data is not connected to an account and therefore cannot be retrieved. Unfortunately, I cannot explain why your   app would just disappear from your phone and I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences this causes.

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case something like this happens again (or you reinstall the app or change your phone). You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under ""Backup"". 

Once again, we are truly sorry about this! If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

312,"Hi Myriam,

There indeed is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

It seems like this barcode format can not be read correctly at the moment. Our developers will have a detailed look at this issue and we hope to make this possible to save this QR code in soon.
As a temporary workaround, I would suggest you save the correct QR code in the section of your Trenitalia card.
In the meantime, please excuse the inconvenience this is causing you.

If you have further questions, suggestions for improvements or general comments, do not hesitate to contact me again.","Ciao Massimo,"

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben.

Uns ist bewusst, dass die Ladezeiten unserer App mit den letzten Updates beträchtlich gestiegen sind.

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

I'm sorry to hear that! I assume you are referring to the pin code that is used to protect your   App with an additional lock screen. 
Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot access the app using the pin code either, it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If I misunderstood you, please feel free to tell me about it. 

Se doveste avere ulteriori domande, proposte per miglioramenti o commenti generali, non esitate a contattarmi di nuovo.

Muchas gracias por tomarte el tiempo para enviarnos tu sugerencia. Nos alegra mucho que te guste  .

Si tienes una tarjeta de Iberia plus que contiene un código QR puedes escanear este código en   y se va a generar del mismo formato en tu aplicación también. 
Lamentablemente no podemos garantizar que esto va a resolver el problema de escaneo ya que estos problemas ocurren principalmente debido a tecnologías de escaneo obsoletas que todavía usan algunas tiendas. Algunos dispositivos (por ejemplo, escáneres láser o escáneres de cama plana) tienen dificultades al leer pantallas de smartphones. Esperamos poder resolver este problema pronto, y que la mayoría de las tiendas reemplacen sus escáneres obsoletos por escáneres con una nueva tecnología, basada en imágenes, en el curso de su próxima actualización del sistema cajero. Hasta entonces, sería mejor pedirle al cajero que ingrese el número de la tarjeta manualmente en estos casos para que no se pierda ningún punto o descuento de recompensa.
En el caso de la tarjeta de Iberia también sería posible que el sistema cajero no reconoce el código de barras ya que la tarjeta actual contiene una banda magnética. En este caso, la mejor opción sería ingresar el número manualmente. 

Mientras tanto, me disculpo sinceramente por las molestias que esto ocasiona.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue with your Costa card! That's indeed unusual! 

Do you mean the digital QR code in   didn't scan in store? Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. This might have also happened with your Costa card. 

We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always try to move the card back and forth in front of the scanning device a little and wait for a visible or audible feedback that your barcode has been picked up properly. In case it still doesn't work properly, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always try to move the card back and forth in front of the scanning device a little and wait for a visible or audible feedback that your barcode has been picked up properly. In case it still doesn't work properly, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.","Best regards,

Unfortunately, the Apple Wallet only supports a few barcode types (QR, Aztec, PDF 417 and Code 128 with iOS 9 or higher).

I'm afraid I'm not quite sure which password it is about. 
If you are referring to the PIN that is used to protect your   App with an additional lock screen, the solution depends on the operating system you are using   on. 
The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. In order to change it, you would need to do so in the general settings of your phone. 

If you are using   on an iOS device you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

Might it be possible that you are referring to the password of your   Backup account?
If you logged in via e-mail, you will find a ""Restore password/Forgot your password?"" button underneath the login button. We will then send you an email with a link to reset your password. 
For the login options Google+ and Facebook, the password of the associated accounts would need to be changed via your Google+/Facebook account.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

There is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, please keep in mind that restoring a backup will overwrite all cards that were previously stored on the device. 

In case you only want to share selected cards with someone else, our Card Sharing feature might be the better choice. You can now share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps. All cards that can be shared now have a ""Share Card"" button below the barcode (iOS) or you can click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your card screen in order to open the menu bar and then choose ""Share"" (Android). 

By sharing a card, you will send a link that enables your friends or family to add your card to their own   app. Please keep in mind though that the link you send expires after a short amount of time due to data privacy issues and has to be send again if it is not opened in time. Please excuse the inconvenience. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any more questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

In case you only want to share selected cards with someone else, our Card Sharing feature might be the better choice. You can now share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps. All cards that can be shared now have a   button below the barcode (iOS) or you can click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your card screen in order to open the menu bar and then choose   (Android). 

By sharing a card, you will send a link that enables your friends or family to add your card to their own   app. Please keep in mind though that the link you send expires after a short amount of time due to data privacy issues and has to be send again if it is not opened in time. Please excuse the inconvenience.

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

If you would like to save a card in  , you can simply do so by scanning the barcode which is printed on your plastic card. It depends on each card whether this will be the back or front side of the card.
Furthermore, you also have the possibility to enter your customer number manually so you wouldn't need to scan your card. However, we can highly recommend using the barcode scanner since this will make it way easier and faster to enter all your cards and can also prevent from entering possible typos. 

The option which allows you to save a picture of the front and back side of your loyalty card in the ""Notes"" section is absolutely voluntary. This is an additional feature which allows you to carry all the card information without having to carry your plastic card.

I hope I could help to answer your question. 

Se doveste avere ulteriori domande, proposte per miglioramenti o commenti generali, non esitate a contattarmi di nuovo.

Hartelijk dank dat u ons gecontacteerd heeft en de tijd neemt ons te vertellen over dit probleem!

Welke flyers of catalogi u ziet in uw 'Aanbiedingen'-sectie in   hangt af van de kaarten die u heeft toegevoegd, evenals de regio's die u heeft ingeschakeld in uw  -instellingen. Helaas besluiten niet alle kaartaanbieders hun flyers of catalogi regelmatig weer te geven. Bovendien willen enkele kaartaanbieders hun catalogi helemaal niet in   tonen. Dat is waarom het mogelijk is dat u geen aanbiedingen ontvangt voor al uw toegevoegde kaarten in  . Aan de andere kant kiezen sommige kaartaanbieders ervoor hun catalogi beschikbaar te maken voor een volledige regio in plaats van enkel voor hun respectievelijke loyaliteitskaarten.

The original idea behind the quadratic shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon.

vielen Dank für Deine Nachricht und dafür, dass Du Dir die Zeit genommen hast, uns Rückmeldung zu geben.

Uns ist bewusst, dass die Ladezeiten unserer App mit den letzten Updates beträchtlich gestiegen sind. Ich kann Dir jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits mit Hochdruck daran arbeiten, diese mit zukünftigen Updates wieder auf ein Minimum zu senken. Bis dahin könntest Du als Übergangslösung versuchen,   während Deines Einkaufs im Hintergrund geöffnet zu lassen. So muss die App nicht bei jedem Öffnen alle Notizen, Kartenbilder, Punktestände, etc. vollständig neu laden und die Ladezeiten sollten sich spürbar verringern. 

In der Zwischenzeit möchte ich mich aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen und hoffe, dass wir Dir   schon bald wieder in verbesserter Geschwindigkeit anbieten können. 

Solltest Du weitere Fragen oder Anregungen haben, kannst Du Dich gerne jederzeit erneut bei mir melden.

We are aware that the load times of our app have risen considerably with the latest updates. However, I can assure you that our developers are working hard to reduce them to a minimum with future updates. Until then you could try as a temporary solution, while your shopping in the background to leave open.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

I'm afraid, once you imported your cards from   to the Apple Wallet they are completely independent from their counterparts in  . This means these cards also have to be removed separately. In order to remove a card from the Wallet, please open the Wallet application via the app icon on your iPhone's home screen instead of via the shortcut from your lock screen. Now, please open your Nectar card in the Wallet and click on the little ""info"" button in the lower right corner of the screen. You should see the option to ""Remove Pass"" in the middle of the screen. 

Unfortunately, due to limitations imposed by Apple it is currently not possible to reorder your imported cards from   in the Apple Wallet. They will automatically get sorted in the order they were added. This means the last card you added will be the first card you see when you open the Apple Wallet. Therefore, I'm afraid, in order to sort your imported cards in   differently it would be necessary to remove all cards from the Wallet application first. Afterwards you can then add them again in your preferred order. Please excuse the inconvenience. 

Furthermore, scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. It's likely that this also happened wth your Nectar card at Sainsbury's. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

Moreover, thank you for your suggestions to provide a link to the card provider's homepage for all cards in  . I'm happy to inform you that for cards that currently have offers available in our ""Offers"" section, we already provides this service. Simply open the offer and click on the location symbol in the lower left corner of the screen. Now, our store finder should open and show you the nearest store locations for this card. If you click on ""Show Details"" for one of these stores, a page with further information (e.g. opening hours, store address and store homepage) will open. We will try to make this possible for all cards in the future. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, this may cause. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. 

Indien u verder nog vragen, suggesties ter verbetering of algemene feedback heeft, contacteer mij dan gerust opnieuw.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue!

Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to manually change the order of your cards in  . They will automatically get sorted alphabetically. However, you could us one of our integrated sorting tools. 

For   on Android devices, you can decide whether you prefer having your cards sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use or by last used. You can change this setting in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Sort card list by"".

For   on iOS devices we offer our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section which will be displayed on top of your card list. They are normally either those four cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, you cannot manually edit the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving these features though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions, suggestions or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Большое спасибо за ваше обращение и за то, что нашли время, чтобы связаться с нами по этому вопросу! К сожалению, я не владею русский, поэтому, надеюсь, вы поймете, если я отвечу на английском:
Many thanks for sending us your feedback! It is very much appreciated. 
Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to manually change the order of your cards in   or sort them by groups. They will automatically get sorted alphabetically. However, you could us one of our integrated sorting tools. 

For   on Android devices, you can decide whether you prefer having your cards sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use or by last used. You can change this setting in your   settings under ""More"" -> ""Sort card list by"".

We are working on further improving these features though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   by different categories. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes. 

I hope this information is helpful to you.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Usually, the notification alert on the   app icon indicates that there are new flyers or catalogues available in your ""Offers"" section in   and should clear as soon as all notifications that are tagged as ""New"" have been opened once. Unfortunately, the notification alert on the   app icon not disappearing even though all new offers in   have already been opened seems to be a bug on very few devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and try to solve it as soon as possible. 

Alternatively, you can also disable the notification badge completely in your general system settings under ""Notifications"" -> "" "" -> ""Badge App Icon"" (iOS) or under ""Application Manager"" -> "" "" -> ""Notifications"" (Android). 

Please keep in mind though that you cannot delete or modify the ""Offers"" section in   since this section ensures that   is and will continue to be free of charge for our users. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon.

Our ""Offers"" section is of course completely voluntary and doesn't have to be used if you don't feel like it adds value to your shopping experience.

Unfortunately, it currently can happen that you get logged out of your points accounts when our app gets updated or after you restored a backup of your cards via our   Backup feature.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

I highly recommend using the   Backup from now on, so that you can retrieve your cards in case something like this happens again (or you reinstall the app or change your phone). You can find the   Backup in your settings in   under '  Backup' (Android devices) or 'Backup' (iOS devices).

I'm afraid, the account you created on our website is for support purposes only. With this account, all support requests you sent to us will get saved and can be referred to later. 

However, there also is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Here you can create you backup account. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to your wife's device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your wife's device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your wife's device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. 
Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake. Therefore, please log out of your   Backup account on your device before you log into your account again on your wife's device. Furthermore, please notice that restoring a backup of your cards on your wife's device will replace all cards she had previously stored in her   app. 

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether it was created successfully.

Thank you for keeping me updated on this issue. I'm happy to hear that my explanation was understandable and you can now share your cards in   with your wife!

Please note though that the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no synchronization between your accounts. That's why, when you add a card on your device, it won't be automatically transferred to your wife's device.

We are constantly trying to improve our app though and a synchronization feature is something we have already been working on for quite some time. I hope that we can include it to   very soon. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this missing feature causes. 

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, we'd be happy to hear from you again.

Thank you very much for the information and for your screenshots! 

Unfortunately, the ""Bad Request 400"" error is a problem with the   Backup login on very few iOS devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of this issue though and are currently trying to solve the problem as soon as possible. I am afraid you might not be able to log into your   Backup account until then. 

Are your cards currently still stored on your device and you wanted to create a backup? If this is the case, I'm happy to inform you that we have been working on changing our entire backup system and will release a new and improved version very soon in order to avoid such problems in the future.

Hartstikke bedankt voor je bericht! Mijn Nederlands is helaas niet zo goed en ik hoop daarom dat het goed is dat ik in het Engels reageer:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

Unfortunately, some stores still use older scanning technologies (e.g. laser scanners or flat bed scanners) which oftentimes have difficulties scanning smartphone displays. It seems like Albert Heijn might be one of those stores but we hope to be able to solve this problem soon. Most stores will hopefully replace their outdated scanners with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

There is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben. Bitte entschuldigen Sie die späte Antwort. 

Haben Sie auf Ihrem alten Gerät ein Backup Ihrer Karten über unsere   Backup Funktion erstellt? Dies ist derzeit leider die einzige Möglichkeit, wie Sie Ihre Karten in   auf ein zweites Smartphone übertragen können. Falls Sie ein Backup erstellt haben, teilen Sie mir bitte mit, welche Login Methode Sie dafür genutzt haben (Google, Facebook oder E-Mail Adresse). 

Sollten Sie noch kein Backup Ihrer Karten erstellt haben, so können Sie das auf folgende Weise tun:

Backup erstellen:
1. Bitte gehen Sie zu den Einstellungen in   und wählen Sie dann ""  Backup"" (Android) oder ""Backup"" (iOS). 
2. Nun können Sie sich entweder mit Facebook, Google oder einer privaten E-Mail Adresse einloggen. 
3. Ihre Karten sind gespeichert, sobald Sie erfolgreich angemeldet sind (iOS), oder Sie können danach auf ""Backup jetzt erstellen"" gehen (Android).

Karten auf einem anderen Gerät wiederherstellen:
1. Bitte gehen Sie wieder über die Einstellungen in   zum   Backup auf Ihrem neuen Handy.
2. Melden Sie sich mit denselben Daten an, wie auf dem alten Gerät (wenn Sie beispielsweise Google benutzt haben, bitte wieder über Google anmelden und nicht über E-Mail Adresse).
3. Sobald Sie angemeldet sind, werden Ihre Karten automatisch wiederhergestellt, oder es öffnet sich ein Fenster mit den Optionen entweder ein neues Backup anzulegen, oder ein altes Backup wiederherzustellen. Bitte wählen Sie die zweite Option aus (Backup wiederherstellen) und danach sollten alle Ihre Karten automatisch auf dem neuen Handy zur Verfügung stehen.

Bitte beachten Sie, dass einige Nutzer Probleme hatten, die Karten über Facebook wiederherzustellen. Ich empfehle daher, entweder Google, oder eine E-Mail Adresse zu verwenden, bis das Problem mit Facebook behoben ist. Des Weiteren würde ich Ihnen raten, darauf zu achten, dass Sie immer nur auf einem Gerät in Ihren   Backup Account eingeloggt sind und nicht auf mehreren Geräten gleichzeitig. 

Falls Sie möchten, dass wir überprüfen, ob Ihr Backup korrekt in unserer Cloud gespeichert wurde, können Sie uns gerne Ihre Login Option mitteilen, nachdem Sie Ihr Backup erstellt haben. 

Ich hoffe, ich konnte Ihnen damit weiterhelfen. Falls etwas nicht funktioniert, oder Sie weitere Fragen haben, können Sie uns gerne jederzeit erneut kontaktieren.

Did you create a backup of your cards on our old device via our backup function? Unfortunately, this is currently the only way you can transfer your cards to a second smartphone. If you have made a backup, please let me know which login method you used (Google, Facebook or email address).

If you have not yet created a backup of your maps, you can do so in the following ways:

Create a backup:
1. Please go to the settings in and then select (Android) or (iOS).
2. Now you can log in either with Facebook, Google or a private e-mail address.
3. Your maps are saved as soon as you are successfully logged in (iOS), or you can then go on (Android).

Restore maps to another device:
1. Please go back over the settings in to the backup on your new phone.
2. Log in with the same data as on the old device (for example, if you used Google, please log back in via Google and not via email address).
3. Once you are logged in, your maps will be restored automatically, or a window will open with the options to either create a new backup or restore an old backup. Please select the second option (restore backup) and then all your cards should be automatically available on the new phone.

Please note that some users had problems restoring the maps via Facebook. I therefore recommend using either Google or an email address until the problem with Facebook is resolved. Furthermore, I would advise you to make sure that you are always logged on only one device in your backup account and not on multiple devices at the same time.

If you would like us to verify that your backup has been properly stored in our cloud, you are welcome to let us know about your login option after you have created your backup.

vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht und dafür, dass Sie Sich die Zeit genommen haben, uns Rückmeldung zu geben. Ich nehme an, dass ich Ihnen auch auf Deutsch antworten kann?

Um möglichst schnell eine Lösung für das von Ihnen beschriebene Problem zu finden, wäre es für mich und unsere Entwickler sehr hilfreich, einige weitere Informationen zu erhalten. Wäre es möglich, dass Sie mir mitteilen, auf welchem iPhone Sie   derzeit verwenden und welche iOS Version Sie nutzen? Darüber hinaus wäre es für uns wichtig zu wissen, welche Version unserer App Sie derzeit nutzen. Um Ihre aktuelle   Version einzusehen, gehen Sie bitte in Ihre Einstellungen in   und wischen Sie bis zum Ende der Einstellungsseite. 

Dürfte ich außerdem fragen, welche Login Methode Sie für das   Backup gewählt haben (Facebook, Google, oder E-Mail Adresse)? Versuchen Sie ein Backup zu erstellen oder wiederherzustellen? Waren Se bei dem Versuch, Sich in Ihren Backup Account einzuloggen, mit einem WLAN-Netzwerk verbunden, oder haben Sie mobile Daten genutzt?

I'm afraid, it is currently not possible to change the entire card icon for your custom cards or to use the front and back pictures of a card from the ""Notes"" section as the icon on the   home screen. The original idea behind the circular shape of the card icon for your ""Other Cards"" was to use a picture of the card provider's logo as the card icon.

Grazie mille per aver trovato il tempo per mettervi in contatto con noi per questo problema! Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano, quindi spero vada bene lo stesso se rispondo in inglese:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I searched our servers and I was able to find a   Backup connected to your Google account daria.prandstraller@gmail.com though. I assume this is the backup you restored on your new device? Our servers show that you originally created this backup with 9 cards in November 2017. However, in December 2017 it was updated and contained only 8 cards afterwards. The last backup you created yesterday also contains these 8 cards. I believe the missing card from the first backup you created might be your Sigma card. Unfortunately, each new backup you create under the same account automatically overwrites the previously stored backup. Therefore, it is not possible for us to retrieve the additional card that was still stored in your account until December 2017. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Which flyers or catalogues you get displayed in your ""Offers"" section in   depends on the cards you have added, as well as the regions you have enabled in your   settings. Unfortunately, not all card providers decide to display their flyers or catalogues regularly. Moreover, some card providers don't want to show their catalogues in   at all. This is why it is possible that you don't receive offers for all of your added cards in  . On the other hand, some card providers decide to make their catalogues available to an entire region instead of only to their respective loyalty card holders. This is why you might see some offers for cards you don't have added. 

Moreover, some companies have different catalogues for different regions within a country. Since you can currently only choose the overall country as your region in   and not a certain state or region within this country, it can happen that there is only one catalogue online which might not be the right one for your location. I can assure you that we are aware of the problem though and will try to differentiate between the states in the future.

Merci pour votre message! Malheureusement, mon français n'est pas si bon. J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas, mais je vais devoir poursuivre en anglais : Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, I'm not sure if I understood your comment correctly though. Are you having difficulties adding a new card to  ? Here is a step-by-step guide how you can add your loyalty cards to  :

1. Open the   App and click on the ""+""-button in the top right corner (iOS) or lower right corner (Android) of the screen.
2. Type in the name of your loyalty card's provider in the search field or scroll through the list. If you can't find the card you would like to include in the list, you can still add it to   by choosing to add it as ""Other card"".
3. Depending on the chosen loyalty card, either the barcode scanner, or a field to manually type in your customer ID will appear. 
4. Simply scan the barcode with your smartphone's camera or manually type in your customer ID. All done! 

In order to make scanning your loyalty cards into   as easy as possible, please ensure that you are in a sufficiently lighted environment first. In addition to that, please try not move the card while scanning it. I would recommend to put the card on a stable surface, for example a table. It might take a few seconds for the camera to focus on the barcode. If this is not working properly, you can also try to slightly move the camera back and forth until the camera focuses properly.

Thank you very much for your screenshots! I now see that you were not referring to our   widget but rather to the imported cards in the Apple Wallet. I'm sorry I misunderstood you! 

Once you imported your cards to the Apple Wallet application they are completely independent from their counterparts in  . This means updating a card in   will not automatically update this card in the Wallet also. To get your updated card to the Wallet again it would therefore be necessary to remove the old card in the Wallet by clicking on the little ""info"" button in the lower right corner and then choosing to ""Remove Pass"". Now you can open the correct card in   and import it to your Apple Wallet again by choosing to ""Share Card"" -> ""Add to Apple Wallet"".

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, currently the problem is that some companies have different catalogues for different regions in Canada (e.g. different prices for ON and AB). Since you can currently only choose the overall region Canada and not a certain province within Canada, it can happen that there is only one catalogue online which might not be the right one for your location. For some cards we already try to localize your offers if you have location services enabled and gave   permission to access your location. I can assure you that we are aware of the problem though and will try to better differentiate between the provinces in the future.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Please excuse the delayed response. 

I'm afraid, the problem is that some companies have different catalogues for different provinces in Canada (e.g. different prices for ON and AB). Since you can currently only choose the region Canada in   and not a certain province within Canada, it can happen that there is only one catalogue online which might not be the right one for your location. I can assure you that we are aware of the problem though and will try to differentiate between the states in the future.

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that we can provide better localized offers in the future.

If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please do not hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us your suggestions to make it possible to group your cards in   into different folders and change a cards position in the card list!

We are always open to new ideas and really appreciate your message. We will discuss your ideas in detail and, if applicable, try to include these features in   in the future. In the meantime, you could try to use our so-called ""Most Relevant"" section which gets displayed on top of your card list. They are normally either those cards that you most frequently use/open (then you'll see a star in the card) or those cards with shops that are close by (then you'll see a location triangle in the card). I'm afraid, it is not possible to manually change the ""Most Relevant"" cards. However, if you want a card to be in the ""Most Relevant"" section, you can simply open it several times in   and restart the app afterwards. 

We are working on further improving this feature though, since we know a lot of users would appreciate being able to arrange their cards in   as they see fit. In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

If you have any more questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, we'd be happy to hear from you again.","Hi Evelyn,"
498,"Hi Grace,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, it seems like there have been problems while scanning the cards from your device. 
These scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. Especially self service machines often use these kind of scanners. In this case, we would recommend you to rather use the usual cash desk in order to see whether this will work for you. Here you can also ask the store staff to type in the card number manually so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update.

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

grazie per il tuo messaggio. Purtroppo non parlo l'italiano bene - so I hope it is alright with you if I answer in English instead:

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it not possible to access the app via Touch ID instead? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our app!

Unfortunately, these scanning issues occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores, Sainsbury's being one of them. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays in general. We are optimistic that this problem will get solved soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these outdated scanning devices with newer image-based scanners which can scan phone displays in a matter of seconds in the course of their next cash system update. Unfortunately, there is not much we can do to get retailers to update their cash systems more quickly. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

Indeed and unfortunately some of our users have problems scanning their barcode at the checkout of a shop from time to time. This is because some stores still use old scanners based on outdated scanning technology. Laser scanners for example, have difficulty reading a smartphone display. Fortunately, the number of such situations is decreasing day by day and soon all stores will have adopted the new scanner technologies. During this time, it is also always possible to enter the card number manually by the cashier. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Thank you for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

I'm afraid the feature to retrieve your current points balance via   is currently only available for selected cards. For those cards you will find a ""Points"" tab in your card screen next to your ""Notes"" tab.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

If you would like to restore your cards that have been saved in the   Backup, you can simply follow these steps: 

1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup""  on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup has been created successfully.

vielen Dank für Deine Nachricht und dafür, dass Du Dir die Zeit genommen hast, uns Rückmeldung zu geben.

Uns ist bewusst, dass die Ladezeiten unserer App mit den letzten Updates beträchtlich gestiegen sind. Ich kann Dir jedoch versichern, dass unsere Entwickler bereits mit Hochdruck daran arbeiten, diese mit zukünftigen Updates wieder auf ein Minimum zu senken. Bis dahin könntest Du als Übergangslösung versuchen,   während Deines Einkaufs im Hintergrund geöffnet zu lassen. So muss die App nicht bei jedem Öffnen alle Notizen, Kartenbilder, Punktestände, etc. vollständig neu laden und die Ladezeiten sollten sich spürbar verringern. 

In der Zwischenzeit möchte ich mich aufrichtig für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigen und hoffe, dass wir Dir   schon bald wieder in verbesserter Geschwindigkeit anbieten können.

Unfortunately, most of these scanning issues occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays in general. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners which can read phone screens in a matter of seconds in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always try to ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

Yes, it is indeed possible to share your cards in   with another   user. You can either share your entire card list by using our   Backup feature ore you can also share selected single cards by using our card sharing feature. 

The   Backup is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, please keep in mind that restoring a   Backup will replace all cards that were previously saved on the device where the backup is being restored. 

In case you don't want to share all of your cards our card sharing feature might be the better choice. With this feature you can share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps. All cards that can be shared now have a ""Share Card"" button below the barcode (iOS) or you can click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your card screen in order to open the menu bar and then choose ""Share"" (Android). 

By sharing a card, you will send a link that enables your friends or family to add your card to their own   app. Please keep in mind though that the link you send expires after a short amount of time due to data privacy issues and has to be send again if it is not opened in time. Please excuse the inconvenience.

Yes, it is indeed possible to share your cards in   with another   user. You can either share your entire card list by using our   Backup feature ore you can also share selected single cards by using our card sharing feature. 

The   Backup is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, please keep in mind that restoring a   Backup will replace all cards that were previously saved on the device where the backup is being restored. 

In case you don't want to share all of your cards our card sharing feature might be the better choice. With this feature you can share selected cards in   via text message, email or various other messaging or social media apps. All cards that can be shared now have a ""Share Card"" button below the barcode (iOS) or you can click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your card screen in order to open the menu bar and then choose ""Share"" (Android). 

By sharing a card, you will send a link that enables your friends or family to add your card to their own   app. Please keep in mind though that the link you send expires after a short amount of time due to data privacy issues and has to be send again if it is not opened in time. Please excuse the inconvenience. 

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any more questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Yes, we indeed offer an additional security feature to protect your cards in  ! Depending on the operating system you are using, you can enable it the following way:

- iPhone: 
If you are using an iPhone which has Touch ID enabled (available on iPhone 5S and later) you can use your unique fingerprint to protect all your rewards cards stored in  . To enable this feature, please open your   settings, go to ""Additional Settings"" and activate the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. In addition to your fingerprint,   will ask you to choose an at least 6-digit pin code as a backup option to access your cards for cases when your Touch ID does not work properly (e.g. when your hands are wet). 

- Android: 
If you are using   on an Android device you can enable the ""  Lock"" in your   settings under ""More"". If you enable the   Lock your cards in   will be secured with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your device from the lock screen will now also be the pin code to access your   app. To secure   with your fingerprint it would therefore be necessary to secure also your lock screen with your fingerprint. 

Please note that the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will only be available in your   settings if Touch ID is enabled and there is already a fingerprint stored in your iPhone settings under ""Touch ID & Passcode"". Similarly, you can only enable the ""  Lock"" feature in your settings in   if you use an unlock method to access your Android device from the lock screen. Please excuse the inconvenience.

There is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards on your old device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to your new device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

I hope I was able to help you. However, if you have any further questions or need further assistance with the   Backup feature, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts.

I am so sorry I misunderstood you!

In order to make scanning your loyalty cards into   as easy as possible, please ensure that you are in a sufficiently lighted environment first. In addition to that, please try not move the card while scanning it. I would recommend to put the card on a stable surface, for example a table. It might take a few seconds for the camera to focus on the barcode. If this is not working properly, you can also try to slightly move the camera back and forth until the camera focuses properly.

If the scanning screen does not open at all, there might be a problem with the permission to access your camera. Could you please double-check whether you gave   permission to access your camera? You can check this setting in your general system settings under "" "" -> ""Camera"". Moreover, have you tried restarting your device yet? This might sound trivial but in many cases a simple phone restart can already solve these issues.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! We really appreciate it and are happy to hear that you like our app!

I'm afraid, the   Backup is limited and not made for synchronization yet. After you restored your backup on a second device, there is no automatic synchronization between your accounts yet. That's why, when you add a card on one of your devices, it won't be automatically transferred to your second device, even if you use the same     Backup account on both devices.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! I'm sorry to hear that!

Are you using   on an Android or iOS device? The ""  Lock"" on Android devices secures your cards in   with your device credentials. This means the pin code you use to access your phone from the lock screen will also be the pin code needed in order to access your   app. 

If you are using   on an iOS device things are a little bit different. Is it possible to access the app via Touch ID right now? If you can access   via Touch ID you can simply open your settings in  , go to ""Additional Settings"" and disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. If you then enable it again you will be asked to choose a new pin code as a backup option for cases when Touch ID doesn't work properly.

If your Touch ID is not working properly and you cannot remember your pin it is still possible to disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature. However, it will be a little bit more complicated. I will explain the procedure to you step by step:

1) Please disable all password protection as well as Touch ID temporarily in your general iPhone system settings.
2) Since both Touch ID and password protection are disabled now, you should be able to access  . However, the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature will not be available in your   settings since Touch ID is disabled on your phone at the moment. Nevertheless, please open your   settings and leave the app opened in the background.
3) Now, go back to your general iPhone settings and enable your Touch ID and password protection again.
4) Immediately go back to your   settings. Since you left it open in the background it should not ask you for a pin code. Now you can disable the ""Lock with Touch ID"" feature und enable it again to choose another pin code.

Regarding your question about changing your device, I'm glad to inform you that there is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you with your problem. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated!

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! 

Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. 

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue - I'm happy to help you with this!

There is a feature in   that allows you to save your cards and/or transfer them to a second mobile device - the   Backup. You can create or restore a backup of your cards the following way:

To save your cards:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""  Backup"" (Android) or ""Backup"" (iOS).
2. Sign in via Facebook, Google or sign up using a private mail address.
3. As soon as you are logged in you have successfully created a backup (iOS) or you can click on ""Backup Now"" to create your backup (Android).

To transfer your data to another device:
1. Go to the ""Settings"" tab in   and choose ""Backup"" again on your new device.
2. Sign in with the same details you used when you created the account (e.g. when you used Google, you have to log in via Google again and not via mail address).
3. After logging in your cards are automatically restored or a pop-up message appears with the options to either ""Restore old Backup"" or ""Create new Backup"". Please select ""Restore old Backup"" and then all your cards should automatically be available again on your new device.

Please note that some users experienced problems with retrieving their cards via Facebook, so I suggest using either Google or a mail address until the problem is solved. Moreover, I would advise you to make sure that you are always only logged into the same   Backup account on one device at a time so that you don't overwrite your backup by mistake.

Please also feel free to contact me again after you created your backup if you would like me to verify whether your backup was created successfully. 

I hope I was able to help you. If you have any further questions or feedback though, please don't hesitate to contact me again.

Merci pour votre message!

En effet et malheureusement certains de nos utilisateurs ont des problèmes à faire scanner leur code-barres à la caisse d’un magasin de temps en temps. Ceci est dû au fait que certains magasins utilisent encore des anciens scanners basant sur une technologie de numérisation dépassée. Les scanners à laser par exemple, ont des difficultés à lire un affichage du smartphone.Heureusement, le nombre de ces situations diminue de jour en jour et bientôt tous les magasins auront adoptés les nouvelles technologies scanner. Pendant ce temps, il est aussi toujours possible de faire entrer le numéro de carte manuellement par l’hôte de caisse. Nous nous excusons pour la gêne occasionnée.

N’hésitez pas à nous recontacter pour toutes questions ou commentaires!

En attendant je vous souhaite une merveilleuse journée.

Indeed and unfortunately some of our users have problems scanning their barcode at the checkout of a shop from time to time. This is because some stores still use old scanners based on outdated scanning technology. Laser scanners for example, have difficulty reading a smartphone display. Fortunately, the number of such situations is decreasing day by day and soon all stores will have adopted the new scanner technologies. During this time, it is also always possible to enter the card number manually by the cashier. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Do not hesitate to contact us for any questions or comments!

In the meantime, I wish you a wonderful day.","Bonjour Philippe, "
595,"Hi   user,

Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to contact us about this issue! Unfortunately, I don't speak Japanese so I hope it is alright if I answer in English instead:

Unfortunately, this duplication of the card number when manually entering it seems to be a bug in   on iOS devices at the moment. I can assure you that our developers are already aware of the problem and are currently trying to solve it as soon as possible. 

Moreover, I will forward your feedback regarding the division of your card number in   to our developers. Maybe we can change this setting for future versions of our app!

In the meantime, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and hope that you can use   in its full functionality again soon. 

If you have any further questions suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me again.
